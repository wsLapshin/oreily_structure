			"description": "<span><p>Vim is a fast and efficient text editor that will make you a faster and more efficient developer. It's available on almost every OS, and if you master the techniques in this book, you'll never need another text editor. In more than 120 Vim tips, you'll quickly learn the editor's core functionality and tackle your trickiest editing and writing tasks. This beloved bestseller has been revised and updated to Vim 7.4 and includes three brand-new tips and five fully revised tips.<br/><br/>A highly configurable, cross-platform text editor, Vim is a serious tool for programmers, web developers, and sysadmins who want to raise their game. No other text editor comes close to Vim for speed and efficiency; it runs on almost every system imaginable and supports most coding and markup languages.<br/><br/>Learn how to edit text the \"Vim way\": complete a series of repetitive changes with The Dot Formula using one keystroke to strike the target, followed by one keystroke to execute the change. Automate complex tasks by recording your keystrokes as a macro. Discover the \"very magic\" switch that makes Vim's regular expression syntax more like Perl's. Build complex patterns by iterating on your search history. Search inside multiple files, then run Vim's substitute command on the result set for a project-wide search and replace. All without installing a single plugin! Three new tips explain how to run multiple ex commands as a batch, autocomplete sequences of words, and operate on a complete search match.<br/><br/><i>Practical Vim, Second Edition</i> will show you new ways to work with Vim 7.4 more efficiently, whether you're a beginner or an intermediate Vim user. All this, without having to touch the mouse.<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b><br/><br/>Vim version 7.4</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Fearlessly change the design of your iOS code with solid unit tests. Use Xcode's built-in test framework XCTest and Swift to get rapid feedback on all your code - including legacy code. Learn the tricks and techniques of testing all iOS code, especially view controllers (UIViewControllers), which are critical to iOS apps. Learn to isolate and replace dependencies in legacy code written without tests. Practice safe refactoring that makes these tests possible, and watch all your changes get verified quickly and automatically. Make even the boldest code changes with complete confidence.</p><p>Manual code and UI testing get slower the deeper your navigation hierarchy goes. It can take several taps just to reach a particular screen, never mind the actual workflow tests. Automatic unit testing offers such rapid feedback that it can change the rules of development. Bring testing to iOS development, even for legacy code. Use XCTest to write unit tests in Swift for all your code.</p><p>iOS developers typically reserve unit tests for their model classes alone. But that approach skips most of the code common to iOS apps, especially with UIViewControllers. Learn how to unit test these view controllers to expand your unit testing possibilities. Since good unit tests form the bedrock for safe refactoring, you're empowered to make bold changes. Learn how to avoid the most common mistakes Swift programmers make with the XCTest framework. Use code coverage to find holes in your test suites. Learn how to identify hard dependencies.</p><p>Reshape the design of your code quickly, with less risk and less fear.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Yes, it is possible to be all things to all people, if you're talking  about the Emacs editor.  As a user, you can make any kind of customization  you want, from choosing the keystrokes that invoke your favorite commands  to creating a whole new work environment that looks like nothing ever  developed before.  It's all in Emacs Lisp -- and in this short but  fast-paced book.GNU Emacs is more than an editor; it's a programming environment, a communications package, and many other things.  To provide such a broad  range of functions, it offers a full version of the Lisp programming  language -- something much more powerful than the little macro languages  provided in other editors (including older versions of Emacs).  GNU Emacs  is a framework in which you can create whole new kinds of editors or just  alter aspects of the many functions it already provides.In this book, Bob Glickstein delves deep into the features that permit far-reaching Emacs customizations.  He teaches you the Lisp language and discusses Emacs topics (such as syntax tables and macro templates) in  easy-to-digest portions.  Examples progress in complexity from simple  customizations to extensive major modes.You will learn how to write interactive commands, use hooks and advice,  perform error recovery, manipulate windows, buffers, and keymaps, exploit  and alter Emacs's main loop, and more.  Each topic is explored through  realistic examples and a series of successive refinements that illustrate  not only the Emacs Lisp language, but the development process as well,  making learning pleasant and natural.</p></span>",

			"title": "Learning the vi and Vim Editors, 7th Edition",
			"description": "<span><p/><div><p>There's nothing that hard-core Unix and Linux users are more fanatical about than their text editor. Editors are the subject of adoration and worship, or of scorn and ridicule, depending upon whether the topic of discussion is your editor or someone else's. <br/><br/><em>vi</em> has been the standard editor for close to 30 years. Popular on Unix and Linux, it has a growing following on Windows systems, too. Most experienced system administrators cite <em>vi</em> as their tool of choice. And since 1986, this book has been <em>the</em> guide for <em>vi</em>. <br/><br/>However, Unix systems are not what they were 30 years ago, and neither is this book. While retaining all the valuable features of previous editions, the 7th edition of <em>Learning the vi and vim Editors</em> has been expanded to include detailed information on <em>vim</em>, the leading <em>vi</em> clone. <em>vim</em> is the default version of <em>vi</em> on most Linux systems and on Mac OS X, and is available for many other operating systems too.<br/><br/>With this guide, you learn text editing basics and advanced tools for both editors, such as multi-window editing, how to write both interactive macros and scripts to extend the editor, and power tools for programmers -- all in the easy-to-follow style that has made this book a classic.<br/><br/><em>Learning the vi and vim Editors</em> includes:<br/><br/><b>A complete introduction to text editing with vi:</b></p><li>How to move around <em>vi</em> in a hurry</li><li>Beyond the basics, such as using buffers</li><li><em>vi's</em> global search and replacement</li><li>Advanced editing, including customizing <em>vi</em> and executing Unix commands</li><br/><br/><b>How to make full use of vim:</b><li>Extended text objects and more powerful regular expressions</li><li>Multi-window editing and powerful <em>vim</em> scripts</li><li>How to make full use of the GUI version of <em>vim</em>, called <em>gvim</em></li><li><em>vim's</em> enhancements for programmers, such as syntax highlighting, folding and extended tags</li><br/><br/>Coverage of three other popular <em>vi</em> clones -- <em>nvi</em>, <em>elvis</em>, and <em>vile</em> -- is also included. You'll find several valuable appendixes, including an alphabetical quick reference to both <em>vi</em> and <em>ex</em> mode commands for regular <em>vi</em> and for <em>vim</em>, plus an updated appendix on <em>vi</em> and the Internet.<br/><br/>Learning either <em>vi</em> or <em>vim</em> is required knowledge if you use Linux or Unix, and in either case, reading this book is essential.  After reading this book, the choice of editor will be obvious for you too.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Learn the extensibility model of Visual Studio to enhance the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE). This book will cover every aspect, starting from developing an extension to publishing it and making it available to the end user. </p>\n\nThe book begins with an introduction to the basic concepts of Visual Studio including data structures and design patterns and moves forward with the fundamentals of the VS extensibility model. Here you will learn how to work on Roslyn - the .NET compiler platform - and load extensions in VS. Next, you will go through the extensibility model and see how various extensions, such as menus, commands, and tool windows, can be plugged into VS. Moving forward, you’ll cover developing VS extensions and configuring them, along with demonstrations on customizing extension by developing option pages.

			"description": "<span><p><b><em>Agile Java™ Development With\nSpring, Hibernate and Eclipse</em></b> is a book about robust\ntechnologies and effective methods which help bring simplicity back\ninto the world of enterprise Java development. The three key\ntechnologies covered in this book, the Spring Framework, Hibernate\nand Eclipse, help reduce the complexity of enterprise Java\ndevelopment significantly. Furthermore, these technologies enable\nplain old Java objects (POJOs) to be deployed in light-weight\ncontainers versus heavy-handed remote objects that require heavy\nEJB containers. This book also extensively covers technologies such\nas Ant, JUnit, JSP tag libraries and touches upon other areas such\nas such logging, GUI based debugging, monitoring using JMX, job\nscheduling, emailing, and more. Also, Extreme Programming (XP),\nAgile Model Driven Development (AMDD) and refactoring are methods\nthat can expedite the software development projects by reducing the\namount of up front requirements and design; hence these methods are\nembedded throughout the book but with just enough details and\nexamples to not sidetrack the focus of this book. In addition, this\nbook contains well separated, subjective material (opinion\nsidebars), comic illustrations, tips and tricks, all of which\nprovide real-world and practical perspectives on relevant topics.\nLast but not least, this book demonstrates the complete lifecycle\nby building and following a sample application, chapter-by-chapter,\nstarting from conceptualization to production using the technology\nand processes covered in this book. In summary, by using the\ntechnologies and methods covered in this book, the reader will be\nable to effectively develop enterprise-class Java applications, in\nan agile manner!</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nYou've probably heard the buzz about Eclipse, the powerful open\nsource platform that gives Java developers a new way to approach\ndevelopment projects. It's like a shiny new car--no longer content\nto just admire Eclipse, you're now itching to get in and drive.\nEclipse is to Java developers what Visual Studio is to .NET\ndevelopers--it's an integrated development environment (IDE) that\ncombines a code editor, compiler, debugger, text editor, graphical\nuser interface (GUI) builder, and other components into a single,\nuser-friendly application. It provides a solid foundation that\nenables Java developers to construct and run integrated\nsoftware-development tools for web development, application design,\nmodeling, performance, testing, and much more. As with any\nextensive programming tool, however, there's a lot to learn. And\nthere s no better guy than well-known Java expert Steve Holzner to\nteach you. An award-winning and best-selling author who has been\nwriting about Java topics since the language first appeared,\nHolzner delivers just the kind of targeted, practical, everyday\nknowledge you need to hone your mastery of Eclipse. Perfect as a\ncompanion to an Eclipse programming tutorial (such as Holzner's own\n<a href=\"Eclipse\">Eclipse</a>,\nO'Reilly, April 2004) or an ideal stand-alone for all those\ndevelopers who either don't want or don't need the tutorial\napproach, the <em>Eclipse Cookbook</em> contains task-oriented\nrecipes for more than 800 situations you may encounter while using\nthis new Java platform--from deploying a web application\nautomatically to reverse engineering compiled code, from re-naming\nall references to a class across multiple packages to initializing\nthe SWT JNI libraries. Each recipe in the ever-popular and utterly\npractical problem-solution-discussion format for O'Reilly cookbooks\ncontains a clear and thorough description of the problem, a brief\nbut complete discussion of a solution, and in-action examples\nillustrating that solution. The <em>Eclipse Cookbook</em> will\nsatiate Java programmers at all levels who are ready to go beyond\ntutorials--far beyond writing plug-ins and extensions--and actually\nuse the powerful and convenient Eclipse day to day.\n</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Discover how Visual Studio 2019 can improve your development process. </p><p>Visual Studio is an integral part of the daily life of millions of developers worldwide. Even as this rich integrated development environment approaches two decades, it has never ceased in innovating ways to make developers’ work life more productive.</p><p><b><i>Essential Visual Studio 2019</i></b> offers explicit guidance for the developer who is already familiar with Visual Studio, but might feel a little lost when it comes to understanding the more recent features and advances of the IDE. Busy developers simply don’t have the time to digest and distill what the latest and greatest tools are with each version. As a result, useful process and performance features may be overlooked. This book, by simply focusing on the most recent innovations in Visual Studio and its tangential developer market, is the perfect \"go to\" for bridging that gap.</p><p>Be ready to plunge headfirst into key features and advances that have been added, expanded, or improved, and topics such as unit testing, refactoring, Git, debugging, containers, and more. You will procure the basic concepts and value first, before diving into hands-on code that is designed to quickly get you up and running.<br/></p><p></p><p>The goal of this book is to bring the developer up to speed on Visual Studio 2019. It does not focus just on functionality added in Visual Studio 2019, but takes a deep dive into the areas where Visual Studio 2019 changed. That way, even if you’re coming from much earlier versions of Visual Studio, you can easily discern how upgrading to Visual Studio 2019 can make you more productive.</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Know how the new features and improvements in Visual Studio 2019 can make you more productive</li><li>Understand the value of modifications and when they can be used to take full advantage of this powerful IDE</li><li>Review changes to Visual Studio over the last two versions and see where the development process is heading</li><li>Discover the cloud-based, containerized, dev-ops-aware, and platform-flexible aspects of Visual Studio</li><li>Gain clarity on the areas that have the greatest impact to you personally</li></ul><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Developers who use Visual Studio on a daily basis. Familiarity with earlier versions is helpful, as the book is not a soup-to-nuts survey of the IDE and some basic functions will not be covered. </p><p><br/></p></span>",

			"title": "Extending and Modifying LAMMPS Writing Your Own Source Code",
			"description": "<span><p><b>Understand the LAMMPS source code and modify it to meet your research needs, and run simulations for bespoke applications involving forces, thermostats, pair potentials and more with ease</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Understand the structure of the LAMMPS source code</li><li>Implement custom features in the LAMMPS source code to meet your research needs</li><li>Run example simulations involving forces, thermostats, and pair potentials based on implemented features</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>LAMMPS is one of the most widely used tools for running simulations for research in molecular dynamics. While the tool itself is fairly easy to use, more often than not you'll need to customize it to meet your specific simulation requirements. Extending and Modifying LAMMPS bridges this learning gap and helps you achieve this by writing custom code to add new features to LAMMPS source code. Written by ardent supporters of LAMMPS, this practical guide will enable you to extend the capabilities of LAMMPS with the help of step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples, and self-assessment questions.</p><p>This LAMMPS book provides a hands-on approach to implementing associated methodologies that will get you up and running and productive in no time. You'll begin with a short introduction to the internal mechanisms of LAMMPS, and gradually transition to an overview of the source code along with a tutorial on modifying it. As you advance, you'll understand the structure, syntax, and organization of LAMMPS source code, and be able to write your own source code extensions to LAMMPS that implement features beyond the ones available in standard downloadable versions.</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll have learned how to add your own extensions and modifications to the LAMMPS source code that can implement features that suit your simulation requirements.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Identify how LAMMPS input script commands are parsed within the source code</li><li>Understand the architecture of the source code</li><li>Relate source code elements to simulated quantities</li><li>Learn how stored quantities are accessed within the source code</li><li>Explore the mechanisms controlling pair styles, computes, and fixes</li><li>Modify the source code to implement custom features in LAMMPS</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for students, faculty members, and researchers who are currently using LAMMPS or considering switching to LAMMPS, have a basic knowledge of how to use LAMMPS, and are looking to extend LAMMPS source code for research purposes. This book is not a tutorial on using LAMMPS or writing LAMMPS scripts, and it is assumed that the reader is comfortable with the basic LAMMPS syntax. The book is geared toward users with little to no experience in source code editing. Familiarity with C++ programming is helpful but not necessary.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>Unleash the power of declarative programming in SwiftUI with practical recipes for building cross-platform Apple applications for iOS 14, macOS, and watchOS using Swift 5.3, Xcode 12, and SwiftUI 2.0</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Apply the declarative programming paradigm for building cross-platform UIs for Apple devices</li><li>Learn to integrate UIKit, Core Data, Sign in with Apple, and Firebase with SwiftUI</li><li>Adopt the new SwiftUI 2.0 features to build visually appealing UIs at speed</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>SwiftUI is an innovative and simple way to build beautiful user interfaces (UIs) for all Apple platforms, right from iOS and macOS through to watchOS and tvOS, using the Swift programming language. In this recipe-based book, you'll work with SwiftUI and explore a range of essential techniques and concepts that will help you through the development process. The recipes cover the foundations of SwiftUI as well as the new SwiftUI 2.0 features introduced in iOS 14. Other recipes will help you to make some of the new SwiftUI 2.0 components backward-compatible with iOS 13, such as the Map View or the Sign in with Apple View.</p><p>The cookbook begins by explaining how to use basic SwiftUI components. Then, you'll learn the core concepts of UI development such as Views, Controls, Lists, and ScrollViews using practical implementation in Swift. By learning drawings, built-in shapes, and adding animations and transitions, you'll discover how to add useful features to the SwiftUI. When you're ready, you'll understand how to integrate SwiftUI with exciting new components in the Apple development ecosystem, such as Combine for managing events and Core Data for managing app data. Finally, you'll write iOS, macOS, and watchOS apps while sharing the same SwiftUI codebase.</p><p>By the end of this SwiftUI book, you'll have discovered a range of simple, direct solutions to common problems found in building SwiftUI apps.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Explore various layout presentations in SwiftUI such as HStack, VStack, LazyHStack, and LazyVGrid</li><li>Create a cross-platform app for iOS, macOS, and watchOS</li><li>Get up to speed with drawings in SwiftUI using built-in shapes, custom paths, and polygons</li><li>Discover modern animation and transition techniques in SwiftUI</li><li>Add user authentication using Firebase and Sign in with Apple</li><li>Handle data requests in your app using Core Data</li><li>Solve the most common SwiftUI problems, such as integrating a MapKit map, unit testing, snapshot testing, and previewing layouts</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for mobile developers who want to learn SwiftUI as well as experienced iOS developers transitioning from UIKit to SwiftUI. The book assumes knowledge of the Swift programming language. Knowledge of object-oriented design and data structures is useful but not necessary.</p></span>",

Number one on my list, every time, is <em>Eclipse:\nBuilding Commercial-Quality Plug-ins.</em> I find it to be the\nclearest and most relevant book about Eclipse for the real-world\nsoftware developer. Other Eclipse books focus on the internal\nEclipse architecture or on repeating the Eclipse documentation,\nwhereas this book is laser focused on the issues and concepts that\nmatter when you're trying to build a product.\"<br/>\n-- Bjorn Freeman-Benson<br/>\nDirector, Open Source Process, Eclipse Foundation</p><p>\"As the title suggests, this massive tome is\nintended as a guide to best practices for writing Eclipse plug-ins.\nI think in that respect it succeeds handily. Before you even think\nabout distributing a plug-in you've written, read this book.\"<br/>\n-- Ernest Friedman-Hill<br/>\nSheriff, JavaRanch.com</p><p>\"<em>Eclipse: Building Commercial-Quality\nPlug-ins</em> was an invaluable training aid for all of our team\nmembers. In fact, training our team without the use of this book as\na base would have been virtually impossible. It is now required\nreading for all our developers and helped us deliver a brand-new,\nvery complex product on time and on budget thanks to the great job\nthis book does of explaining the process of building plug-ins for\nEclipse.\"<br/>\n-- Bruce Gruenbaum</p><p>\"This is easily one of the most useful books\nI own. If you are new to developing Eclipse plug-ins, it is a\n'must-have' that will save you lots of time and effort. You will\nfind lots of good advice in here, especially things that will help\nadd a whole layer of professionalism and completeness to any\nplug-in. The book is very focused, well-structured, thorough,\nclearly written, and doesn't contain a single page of 'waffly page\nfiller.' The diagrams explaining the relationships between the\ndifferent components and manifest sections are excellent and aid in\nunderstanding how everything fits together. This book goes well\nbeyond Actions, Views, and Editors, and I think everyone will\nbenefit from the authors' experience. I certainly have.\"<br/>\n-- Tony Saveski</p><p>\"The authors of this seminal book have\ndecades of proven experience with the most productive and robust\nsoftware engineering technologies ever developed. Their experiences\nhave now been well applied to the use of Eclipse for more effective\nJava development. A must-have for any serious software engineering\nprofessional!\"<br/>\n-- Ed Klimas</p><p>\"Just wanted to also let you know this is an\nexcellent book! Thanks for putting forth the effort to create a\nbook that is easy to read and technical at the same time!\"<br/>\n-- Brooke Hedrick</p><p>\"The key to developing great plug-ins for\nEclipse is understanding where and how to extend the IDE, and\nthat's what this book gives you. It is a must for serious plug-in\ndevelopers, especially those building commercial applications. I\nwouldn't be without it.\"<br/>\n-- Brian Wilkerson</p><p>\"If you're looking for just one Eclipse\nplug-in development book that will be your guide, this is the one.\nWhile there are other books available on Eclipse, few dive as deep\nas <em>Eclipse: Building Commercial-Quality Plug-ins.</em>\"<br/>\n-- Simon Archer</p><p>Eclipse has established itself as a dominant\nforce in the application-development space. Key to the success of\nEclipse is the ability of developers to extend its functionality\nusing plug-ins.</p><p>This new edition of <em>Eclipse: Building\nCommercial-Quality Plug-ins</em> is the definitive, start-to-finish\nguide to building commercial-quality Eclipse plug-ins, with an\nemphasis on adding the sophistication and polish that paying\ncustomers demand. The book provides both a quick introduction to\nusing Eclipse for new users and a reference for experienced Eclipse\nusers wishing to expand their knowledge and improve the quality of\ntheir Eclipse-based products.</p><p>Revised to take advantage of pure Eclipse\n3.1 and 3.2 APIs, this widely praised bestseller presents detailed,\npractical coverage of every aspect of plug-in development and\nspecific solutions for the challenges developers are most likely to\nencounter. All code examples, relevant API listings, diagrams, and\nscreen captures have been updated.</p><p>Some Eclipse concepts--such as actions,\nviews, and editors--have not changed radically, but now have\nadditional functionality and capabilities. Other areas, such as the\nEclipse plug-in infrastructure, have changed drastically due to the\nEclipse shift towards an OSGi-based infrastructure. This edition is\nfully updated to address these new advances for Eclipse\ndevelopers.</p><li><p>Includes a quick introduction to Eclipse for experienced Java\nprogrammers</p></li><li><p>Serves as a systematic reference for experienced Eclipse\nusers</p></li><li><p>Introduces all the tools you need to build Eclipse and Rational\nplug-ins</p></li><li><p>Explains the Eclipse architecture and the structure of plug-ins\nand extension points</p></li><li><p>Offers practical guidance on building Eclipse user interfaces\nwith SWT and JFace</p></li><li><p>Shows how to use change tracking, perspectives, builders,\nmarkers, natures, and more</p></li><li><p>Covers internationalization, help systems, features, and\nbranding</p></li><p>This book is designed for anyone who wants a\ndeep understanding of Eclipse, and every experienced developer\ninterested in extending Eclipse or the Rational Software\nDevelopment Platform.</p><p><br/><br/></p></span></span>",

Congratulations to Eric Lippert and Eric\nCarter for such a valuable work!”<br/>\n<em>—Tim Huckaby, CEO, InterKnowlogy, Microsoft regional\ndirector</em>\n</p><p>\n“This book covers in a clear and concise way all of the\nins and outs of programming with Visual Studio Tools for Office.\nGiven the authors’ exhaustive experiences with this subject,\nyou can’t get a more authoritative description of VSTO than\nthis book!”<br/>\n<em>—Paul Vick, technical lead, Visual Basic .NET, Microsoft\nCorporation</em>\n</p><p>\n“Eric and Eric really get it. Professional programmers\nwill love the rich power of Visual Studio and .NET, along with the\nability to tap into Office programmability. This book walks you\nthrough programming Excel, Word, InfoPath, and Outlook\nsolutions.”<br/>\n<em>—Vernon W.

It is a\nmust-have book for anyone doing Office development.”<br/>\n<em>—Siew Moi Khor, programmer/writer, Microsoft\nCorporation</em>\n</p><p>\n“We don’t buy technical books for light reading. We\nbuy them as a resource for developing a solution. This book is an\nexcellent resource for someone getting started with Smart Client\ndevelopment. For example, it is common to hear a comment along the\nlines of, ‘It is easy to manipulate the Task Pane in Office\n2003 using VSTO 2005,’ but until you see something like the\nexample at the start of Chapter 15, it is hard to put\n‘easy’ into perspective. This is a thorough book that\ncovers everything from calling Office applications from your\napplication, to building applications that are Smart Documents. It\nallows the traditional Windows developer to really leverage the\npower of Office 2003.”<br/>\n<em>—Bill Sheldon, principal engineer, InterKnowlogy,\nMVP</em>\n</p><p>\n“Eric Carter and Eric Lippert have been the driving force\nbehind Office development and Visual Studio Tools for Office 2005.\nThe depth of their knowledge and understanding of VSTO and Office\nis evident in this book. Professional developers architecting\nenterprise solutions using VSTO 2005 and Office System 2003 now\nhave a new weapon in their technical arsenal.”<br/>\n<em>—Paul Stubbs, program manager, Microsoft\nCorporation</em>\n</p><p>\n“This book is both a learning tool and a reference book,\nwith a richness of tables containing object model objects and their\nproperties, methods, and events. I would recommend it to anyone\nconsidering doing Office development using the .NET framework,\nespecially people interested in VSTO programming.”<br/>\n<em>—Rufus Littlefield, software design engineer/tester,\nMicrosoft Corporation</em>\n</p><p><b><em>Visual Studio Tools for Office</em></b> is both the first\nand the definitive book on VSTO 2005 programming, written by the\ninventors of the technology. VSTO is a set of tools that allows\nprofessional developers to use the full power of Visual Studio .NET\nand the .NET Framework to put code behind Excel 2003, Word 2003,\nOutlook 2003, and InfoPath 2003.</p><p>VSTO provides functionality never before available to the Office\ndeveloper: data binding and data/view separation, design-time views\nof Excel and Word documents inside Visual Studio, rich support for\nWindows Forms controls in a document, the ability to create custom\nOffice task panes, server-side programming support against Office,\nand much more.</p><p>Carter and Lippert cover their subject matter with deft insight\ninto the needs of .NET developers learning VSTO.

			"description": "<span><div><p>With start-up templates for projects ranging from Windows applications to web services, and extensive help and on-line documentation, Visual Studio .NET might be mistaken for a tool for unsophisticated users. It's true that most developers soon discover that the basic operation of Visual Studio is fairly self-explanatory; less obvious are some of the suite's more advanced built-in features.Visual Studio .Net includes a wealth of little-used capabilities, is very customizable, has a complete automation model, and much more. On top of its regular feature set, there are hosts of free add-ins, macros, and power toys that can further enhance the functionality of Visual Studio. This book is all about exploring these things, and in doing so, becoming a better and more efficient developer.  Developers will learn how to:</p><ul><li>Get the most out of projects and solutions, including getting down and dirty with the undocumented format of project and solution files</li><li>Use these editor features to the fullest, and add additional functionality to the editor through the use of third-party add-ins</li><li>Learn smarter ways to navigate the application and your own source code</li><li>Customize shortcut keys, toolbars, menus, the toolbox, and much more</li><li>Use the debugger successfully not only on your source code, but with T-SQL and scripting languages as well</li><li>Automatically generate code</li><li>Learn how the server  can be used to interface with databases, services, and performance counters, as well as WMI</li><li>Use and create Visual Studio add-ins to extend its functionality</li></ul>Offering valuable tips, tools, and tricks, <i>Visual Studio Hacks</i> takes you far beyond the suite's usual capabilities. You can read this book from cover to cover or, because each hack stands its own, you can feel free to browse and jump to the different sections that interest you most. If there's a prerequisite you need to know about, a cross-reference will guide you to the right hack.If you want to experience the full spectrum of Visual Studio's functionality and flexibility, you'll find the perfect guide for exploration in <i>Visual Studio Hacks</i>. Once the final page is turned, you can confidently say that you've been exposed to everything that Visual Studio .NET is capable of doing.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><span><p>You can have the best coders in the world working in your teams, but if your project management isn't up to scratch, your project is almost certain to be delayed, to come in over budget, and in some cases to fail entirely. By taking precise control of your application development process, you can make changes, both large and small, throughout your project's life cycle that will lead to better–quality finished products that are consistently delivered on time and within budget.</p><p>Application lifecycle management (ALM) is an area of rapidly growing interest within the development community. Because its techniques allow you to deal with the process of developing applications across many areas of responsibility and across many different disciplines, its effects on your project can be wide ranging and pronounced. It is a project management tool that has practical implications for the whole team—from architects to designers, from developers to testers.</p><p>This book focuses on the most powerful ALM tool available for the Microsoft .NET Framework: Visual Studio Team System (VSTS). It demonstrates the key concepts and techniques of ALM and illustrates how they can be achieved using the tools VSTS provides in a clear succinct style. After reading the book, you will understand how VSTS can be used to generate continuous meaningful reporting on your project's health for the decision makers on your team as well as for your project's sponsors.</p></span></span></span></span>",

This is in large part due to the phenomenal, relatively recent success of mobile computing, text messaging on mobile phones, and the proliferation of small devices like the Blackberry and Palm Pilot. Compared with the recent past, when text entry was primarily through the standard \"qwerty\" keyboard, people today use a diverse array of devices with the number and variety of such devices ever increasing. The variety is not just in the devices, but also in the technologies used: entry modalities have become more varied and include speech recognition and synthesis, handwriting recognition, and even eye-tracking using image processing on web-cams. Statistical language modeling has advanced greatly in the past ten years and so therein is potential to facilitate and improve text entry — increasingly, the way people communicate.</p><ul><li>This book covers different aspects of text entry systems and offers prospective researchers and developers</li><li>Global guidelines for conducting research on text entry, in terms of design strategy, evaluation methodology, and requirements</li><li>History and current state of the art of entry systems, including coverage of recent research topics</li><li>Specific guidelines for designing entry systems for a specific target, depending on devices, modalities, language, and different physical conditions of users</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>You can have the best coders in the world working in your teams, but if your project management isn't up to scratch, your project is almost certain to be delayed, to come in over budget, and in some cases to fail entirely. By taking precise control of your application development process, you can make changes, both large and small, throughout your project's life cycle that will lead to better–quality finished products that are consistently delivered on time and within budget.</p><p>Application lifecycle management (ALM) is an area of rapidly growing interest within the development community. Because its techniques allow you to deal with the process of developing applications across many areas of responsibility and across many different disciplines, its effects on your project can be wide ranging and pronounced. It is a project management tool that has practical implications for the whole team—from architects to designers, from developers to testers.</p><p><em>Pro Application Lifecycle Management with Visual Studio 2012</em> focuses on the most powerful ALM tool available for the Microsoft .NET Framework: Visual Studio Team Foundation Server. It demonstrates the key concepts and techniques of ALM at first with a guide to the overall methodology, and then delves into architecture and testing--illustrating all of the concepts, tips and tricks using the tools TFS provides. The book serves as a complete guide to the ALM style--with no fluff and many relevant code samples and examples.</p><p>After reading the book, you will understand how TFS can be used to generate continuous meaningful reporting on your project's health for the decision makers on your team as well as for your project's sponsors.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>What ALM is and what it can do for you</p></li><li><p>How to achieve traceability in your projects</p></li><li><p>How to improve your development process</p></li><li><p>Why TFS is so much more than just a version control tool</p></li><li><p>The new features in TFS that help encourage ALM best practices, especially within Metro and .NET 4.5 applications</p></li><li><p>What the importance of well–designed and well–defined processes is and how to implement these things</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book will be of value for anyone developing applications with Visual Studio Team Foundation Server, whether they are working in a small team of just a few people or in a large enterprise environment.</p></span></span>",

With hundreds of features and several different editions available, it can be hard to learn your way around, and hard to know whether you're using it to its full potential. <em>Visual Studio Condensed</em> gives you a quick and systematic guide to the features that matter most, tagged clearly according to their availability.</p><p>The book starts by familiarizing you with the main features of Visual Studio and how to configure the user interface depending on your needs. You'll then dive into each key developer tool in turn, starting with the editor window and going through the navigation pane, documentation, and the NuGet package manager. Debugging is a difficult skill to master with a range of approaches and tools at your disposal, so you'll see how to make best use of breakpoints, the debugging windows, tracing and managed memory analysis, as well as tips and tricks on advanced debugging techniques that can make a real difference to your productivity.</p><p>Visual Studio 2013 comes with sophisticated code improvement tools. You can visualize relationships in your code with the Code Map feature, find duplicated code to maximize your code reuse, and use Visual Studio's inbuilt list of metrics to figure out just how healthy your code is and how difficult or easy it will be to maintain. Testing is also made easy with unit testing and web performance tests as well as a Test Manager to organize your tests into test plans and suites. The final chapters of the book cover team work with Team Foundation Server, framework-specific features, and how to build your own Visual Studio extensions.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><b>This book is a comprehensive guide to community engagement and investment, beginning with a survey of community-related voluntary standards and then turning to strategy and management, community engagement, community investment and reporting and communications on community-related activities.</b><p>Sustainability is about the long-term wellbeing of society, an issue that encompasses a wide range of aspirational targets including ending poverty and hunger; ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all; ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all; and promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.</p><p>Clearly the challenges associated with pursuing the goals are daunting and for most businesses it may be difficult for them to see how they can play a meaningful role in address them.  While it is common for “society” to be identified as an organizational stakeholder, the reality is that one company cannot, acting on its own, achieve all the goals associated with societal wellbeing.   However, every company, regardless of its size, can make a difference in some small, yet meaningful way, in the communities in which they operate, and more and more attention is being focused on the impact that companies have within their communities.  Focusing on the community level allows an organization to set meaningful targets and implement programs that fit the scale of its operations and which can provide the most immediate value to the organization and its stakeholders.  Societal wellbeing projects and initiatives must ensure that the organization does not compromise, and instead improves, the wellbeing of local communities through its value chain and in society-at-large.</p><p>This book is a comprehensive guide to community engagement and investment, beginning with a survey of community-related voluntary standards and then turning to strategy and management, community engagement, community investment and reporting and communications on community-related activities.</p></span>",

			"title": "Embedded Linux Development Using Eclipse",
			"description": "<span>\nThe Eclipse environment solves the problem of having to maintain your own Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is time consuming and costly.  Embedded tools can also be easily integrated into Eclipse. The C/C++CDT is ideal for the embedded community with more than 70% of embedded developers using this language to write embedded code. Eclipse simplifies embedded system development and then eases its integration into larger platforms and frameworks. <br/><br/>In this book, Doug Abbott examines Eclipse, an IDE, which can be vital in saving money and time in the design and development of an embedded system.  Eclipse was created by IBM in 2001 and then became an open-source project in 2004. Since then it has become the de-facto IDE for embedded developers. Virtually all of the major Linux vendors have adopted this platform, including MontVista, LynuxWorks, and Wind River.<br/><br/>*Details the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE) essential to streamlining your embedded development process<br/>*Overview of the latest C/C++ Developer's Toolkit (CDT)<br/>*Includes case studies of Eclipse use including Monta Vista, LynuxWorks, and Wind River\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>The advent of iOS 5 and the newest Xcode has unveiled an innovative, design-centric set of tools called Storyboarding, for you to more easily conceptualize and design your app from top to bottom. A time saver for sure, but it's new!</p><p><b>Dr. Rory Lewis, Yulia McCarthy</b> and <b>Stephen Moraco</b> — a best selling Apress author, a former Apple iOS engineering group intern and a successful app developer — have teamed up to bring you this book, <em>Beginning iOS Storyboarding</em>. The three authors have found a beautiful way to lead the beginner into Storyboarding and at the same time show old school coders of Objective-C the new and exquisite methodology of this incredible tool.</p><p>For the beginner who has never programmed, <em>Beginning iOS Storyboarding</em> shows how to extract those cool and innovative app ideas you have in your head into a working app ready for sale on the iTunes store by using Apple's new technology that allows you to skip chunks of code by just dragging scenes and segues onto your Storyboard canvas.</p><p>Even if you're an intermediate or pro-level Objective-C developer, you can still learn the ins and outs of Xcode's new Storyboarding feature, and find new ways of building and debugging your new Storyboarding app. Yup: This book is also for you, too.</p><p>In this book, you get the following, beyond learning the fundamentals and classical elements of Storyboarding:</p><li><p>Design and build utilities and a location based service app using Storyboarding techniques</p></li><li><p>Design and build a universal app with a rich user interface and user experience (UX)</p></li><li><p>Create a fun game app, and more</p></li><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>How iOS Storyboarding is like a different planet in the Xcode universe. We do this by introducing you to the standard transitions to views, passing data to the views, returning data from the views, and, lastly, showing how to navigate the critical transitions to views.</p></li><li><p>How to develop a simple utility app using Storyboarding. Here we learn the foundation of many apps, which is how to place controls on the settings screen of a utility application and to return those settings to the main view of the app via the settings view delegate protocol.</p></li><li><p>How to develop an app with an advanced MKMapView. Specifically, we introduce you to override the default views provided by Apple's initial project templates. This opens the door to you being able to code specialized views such as MKMapView, and utilize iOS Location Services for building navigation-based apps.</p></li><li><p>What are the cool, powerful tools that enable you to create page controller view transitions. We dig deep into the ins and outs of how to apply the UIPageControls to display views and supply traditional view notification to controlled views.</p></li><li><p>How to create a very cool universal app while you learn how to develop table views, which in the iPad case, present themselves differently depending upon the device orientation using the UISplitViewController.</p></li><li><p>How to build a universal app with two Storyboards (one for iPhone, one for iPad) and provide techniques and tips for developing universal apps.</p></li><li><p>How to build a tabbed app that stores and manages user documents in the iCloud.</p></li><li><p>How to develop a cool game app which stretches your knowledge of how segues can be used to provide much more complex navigation paths between screens and devices, as well as accessibility with Apple's iOS Game Center.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for the beginner who has never programmed, but can use the Storyboarding tool in Xcode to get up and running fast. This book is also for experienced iOS developers who wish to learn Storyboarding to quickly cut down on their app development and debugging time.</p></span></span>",

You present it to the group, but get confounding questions, inane comments, and verbal bullets in return. Before you know what's happened, your idea is dead, shot down. You're furious. Everyone has lost: Those who would have benefited from your proposal. You. Your company. Perhaps even the country.<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be this way, maintain John Kotter and Lorne Whitehead. In Buy-In, they reveal how to win the support your idea needs to deliver valuable results. The key? Understand the generic attack strategies that naysayers and obfuscators deploy time and time again. Then engage these adversaries with tactics tailored to each strategy. By \"inviting in the lions\" to critique your idea--and being prepared for them--you'll capture busy people's attention, help them grasp your proposal's value, and secure their commitment to implementing the solution.<br/><br/>The book presents a fresh and amusing fictional narrative showing attack strategies in action. It then provides several specific counterstrategies for each basic category the authors have defined--including:<br/><br/>·         Death-by-delay: Your enemies push discussion of your idea so far into the future it's forgotten.<br/><br/>·         Confusion: They present so much data that confidence in your proposal dies.<br/><br/>·         Fearmongering: Critics catalyze irrational anxieties about your idea.<br/><br/>·         Character assassination: They slam your reputation and credibility.<br/><br/>Smart, practical, and filled with useful advice, Buy-In equips you to anticipate and combat attacks--so your good idea makes it through to make a positive change.<br/></div></span>",

When standard widgets aren’t enough,\ngraphics built with GEF are often the best solution. <em><b>The\nEclipse Graphical Editing Framework (GEF)</b></em> covers everything\nJava tool developers need to create tomorrow’s richest, most\nvisual interfaces.</p><p>This practical, hands-on guide begins by\nintroducing GEF, Draw2D, and Zest, and demonstrating what can be\nachieved with them. Next, the authors walk through building a\nsimple Draw2D example, helping new GEF developers understand the\ncore capabilities available to them. Building on this foundation,\nthey progressively introduce more of the Draw2D frameworks,\nincluding Figures, Layout Managers, Connections, Layers, and\nViewports. They present a chapter-length graph visualization\nproject based on Zest, followed by detailed coverage of non-Draw2D\nportions of the GEF.</p><p>The book’s final section walks\nstep-by-step through developing a complete GEF editor. Each chapter\nfocuses on a different aspect of the problem, and includes\nchallenges, solutions, diagrams, screenshots, cookbook-style code\nexamples, and more.</p><p>This book is organized to help developers\nsolve immediate problems quickly, while also gaining in-depth\nknowledge for building advanced solutions. Relevant APIs are\nincluded in several chapters, making this an even more useful\nstandalone reference.</p><p>This book</p><li><p>Introduces GEF application components such as shapes, flow,\nlogic, and text</p></li><li><p>Explains Draw2D architecture, drawing features, and event\nprocessing</p></li><li><p>Shows how to create and customize figures, use painting and\nborders, and work with each Draw2D Layout Manager</p></li><li><p>Thoroughly explains GEF models, including domain and\npresentation information, populating diagrams, and more</p></li><li><p>Shows how to use Zest’s content providers, filters, and\nlayout algorithms</p></li><li><p>Covers EditParts, EditPolicies, Tools, Commands, Actions, and\nmuch more</p></li><p><b><em>The Eclipse Graphical Editing\nFramework (GEF)</em></b> is the best resource for all Java tool\ndevelopers who want to construct sophisticated graphical editing\nproducts that integrate with Eclipse, for experienced Eclipse users\nwho want to start creating their own graphical tools, and for\nanyone who wants to see what makes GEF tick.</p></span></span>",

The book will showcase new features in Visual Studio 2010 that ease the creation of applications.  Real-world applications will be used throughout to demonstrate the features and ease of use. This book is for professional developers who are working with previous versions of Visual Studio and are looking to make the move to Visual Studio 2010 Professional. The book is not a language primer, a language reference, or a single technology book. It’s a book that will help professional developers move from previous versions of Visual Studio (starting with 2003 and on up). It will cover the features of Visual Studio 2010 through an application. It will go through a lot of the exciting new language features and new versions of the most popular technologies without putting the emphasis on the technologies themselves. It will instead put the emphasis on how you would get to those new tools and features from Visual Studio 2010. If you are expecting this book to thoroughly cover the new Entity Framework or ASP.NET MVC 2, this is not the book for you. If you want to read a book where the focus is on Visual Studio 2010 and on the reasons for moving to Visual Studio 2010, this is the book for you.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>A must-have guide that covers all the new features of Visual Studio 2010</b></p><p>Visual Studio allows you to create and manage programming projects for the Windows platform, and the new 2010 version has undergone a major overhaul comprised of significant changes. Written by an author team of veteran programmers and developers, Professional Visual Studio 2010 gets you quickly up to speed on what you can expect from the newest version of Visual Studio.</p><p>This book's first section is dedicated to familiarizing you with the core aspects of Visual Studio 2010. Everything you need is contained in the first five chapters, from the IDE structure and layout to the various options and settings you can change to make the user interface synchronize with your own way of doing things.</p><p>From there, the remainder of the book is broken into 11 parts:</p><ul><li><p><b>Getting Started:</b> In this part, you learn how to take control of your projects and organize them in ways that work with your own style.</p></li><li><p><b>Digging Deeper:</b> Though the many graphical components of Visual Studio that make a programmer's job easier are discussed in many places throughout this book, you often need help when you're in the process of actually writing code. This part deals with features that support the coding of applications such as IntelliSense, code refactoring, and creating and running unit tests In the latest version of the .NET framework, enhancements were added to support dynamic languages and move towards feature parity between the two primary .NET languages, C# and VB. This part covers changes to these languages, as well as looking at a range of features that will help you write better and more consistent code.</p></li><li><p><b>Rich Client and Web Applications:</b> For support building everything from Office add-ins to cloud applications, Visual Studio enables you to develop applications for a wide range of platforms. These two parts cover the application platforms that are supported within Visual Studio 2010, including ASP.NET and Office, WPF, Silverlight 2 and ASP.NET MVC.</p></li><li><p><b>Data:</b> A large proportion of applications use some form of data storage. Visual Studio 2010 and the .NET Framework include strong support for working with databases and other data sources. This part examines how to use DataSets, the Visual Database Tools, LINQ, Synchronization Services and ADO.NET Entity Framework to build applications that work with data. It also shows you how you can then present this data using Reporting.</p></li><li><p><b>Application Services:</b> Through the course of building an application you are likely to require access to services that may or may not reside within your organization. This part covers core technologies such as WCF, WF, Synchronization Services and WCF RIA services that you can use to connect to these services.</p></li><li><p><b>Configuration and Internationalization:</b> The built-in support for configuration files allows you to adjust the way an application functions on the fly without having to rebuild it. Furthermore, resource files can be used to both access static data and easily localize an application into foreign languages and cultures. This part of the book shows how to use .NET configuration and resource files.</p></li><li><p><b>Debugging:</b> Application debugging is one of the more challenging tasks developers have to tackle, but correct use of the Visual Studio 2010 debugging features will help you analyze the state of the application and determine the cause of any bugs. This part examines the rich debugging support provided by the IDE.</p></li><li><p><b>Build and Deployment:</b> In addition to discussing how to build your solutions effectively and getting applications into the hands of your end users, this part also deals with the process of upgrading your projects from previous versions.</p></li><li><p><b>Customizing and Extending Visual Studio:</b> If the functionality found in the previous part isn't enough to help you in your coding efforts, Microsoft has made Visual Studio 2010 even more extensible. This part covers the automation model, how to write add-ins and macros, and then how to use a new extensibility framework, MEF, to extend Visual Studio 2010.</p></li><li><p><b>Visual Studio Ultimate:</b> The final part of the book examines the additional features only available in the Premium and Ultimate versions of Visual Studio 2010. In addition, you'll also learn how the Team Foundation Server provides an essential tool for managing software projects.</p></li></ul><p>Though this breakdown of the Visual Studio feature set provides the most logical and easily understood set of topics, you may need to look for specific functions that will aid you in a particular activity. To address this need, references to appropriate chapters are provided whenever a feature is covered in more detail elsewhere in the book.</p><p><em>Professional Visual Studio 2010</em> is for all developers new to Visual Studio as well as those programmers who have some experience but want to learn about features they may have previously overlooked.</p><p>If you are familiar with the way previous versions of Visual Studio worked, you may want to skim over Part I, which deals with the basic constructs that make up the user interface, and move on to the remainder of the book where the new features found in Visual Studio 2010 are discussed in detail. While you may be familiar with most of Part I, it is worth reading this section in case there are features of Visual Studio 2010 that you haven't seen or used before.</p><p>If you're just starting out, you'll greatly benefit from the first part, where basic concepts are explained and you're introduced to the user interface and how to customize it to suit your own style.</p></span></span>",

Systems range from the humble to the exotic, and despite the growing acceptance of the technology, many users, both new and experienced, find the complexity of the operation and the time spent loading the material and rendering effects difficult to manage at first. Non-linear editing also comes with its own specialist language, requiring each editor to be conversant with a new range of skills from day one. As desktop systems improve the role of the traditional editor is constantly evolving and expanding.<br id=\"CRLF\"/><br id=\"CRLF\"/><br id=\"LF\"/><br id=\"CRLF\"/>\nThis is an operational manual for professional trainees and students in the post-production industry. It will also serve as a useful reference tool for producers and directors. Written in a concise and clear manner, the book serves as a practical guide to the efficient management and operation of non-linear editing systems.

It’s the process.<br/><br/><i>The First Mile</i> focuses on the critical moment when an innovator moves from planning to reality. It is a perilous place where hidden traps snare entrepreneurs and roadblocks slow innovators inside large companies.<br/><br/>In this practical and enlightening manual, strategic adviser Scott Anthony equips innovators with new tools, questions, and examples to speed through this crucial early stage of innovation. You’ll learn:<br/><br/>  How to evaluate your idea’s strengths and weaknesses using the DEFT” processDocument, Evaluate, Focus, and Test<br/>  Fourteen recipes from an experiment cookbook” to gain confidence in your idea or business<br/>  Why spinouts,” wrong turns,” and other challenges commonly trip up innovationand the practical strategies you can use to avoid them<br/>  Why innovators need to seek chaos in an age of constant changeand other essential leadership skills<br/><br/>Drawing on his decade of experience as an innovation adviser and investor, Anthony describes hard-won lessons from disruptive start-ups and global giants alike. <i>The First Mile</i> will give you the knowledge and confidence to travel this perilousbut ultimately promisingterrain.<br/><br/>The first mile can be a scary place, but you don’t have to traverse it alone. This book can help.<br/></div></span>",

While this Wrox Blox focuses on Visual Studio 2008 and .NET 3.5, developers should know that the concepts for creating custom controls in Visual Studio 2005 and .NET 2.0 with ASP.NET AJAX 1.0 are very similar. Visual Studio 2008 offers many improvements concerning JavaScript editing/debugging, and .NET 3.5 includes ASP.NET AJAX right out of the box, simplifying the install to get AJAX up and running.</p><p>This Wrox Blox takes developers gradually through creating a custom ASP.NET AJAX control. JavaScript is essential for writing ASP.NET AJAX controls, but quite a few developers still struggle in this area. Given this fact, this Wrox Blox takes a compressive look at JavaScript and the improvements that the Microsoft AJAX Library provides to client-side development, giving readers the skills they need to delve straight into creating a \"news scroller\" type control from start to finish with step-by-step instructions throughout.</p></span></span>",
