			"title": "The Bitcoin Standard",
			"description": "<span><p>When a pseudonymous programmer introduced “a new electronic cash system that’s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party” to a small online mailing list in 2008, very few paid attention. Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.</p><p>While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse.</p><p>With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin’s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments—a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.</p><p>Ammous’ firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders.</p><p>The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin’s ‘blockchain technology’? <i>The Bitcoin Standard</i> is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet’s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Deepen your understanding of blockchain technology and develop your own blockchain applications. This book provides a thorough review of distribution-based systems on blockchain technology, starting from the fundamental concepts that underlie it, all the way through the implementation of a blockchain network for business purposes. </p><p></p><p>Author <b>Joseph Thachil George</b> begins by introducing you to blockchain and some basic concepts of technology, including distributed systems, systems of systems, cyber-physical systems, the Byzantine Consensus, the CAP theorem, and cryptographic techniques. Next, he analyzes the structure of blocks and smart contracts and the mother of all blockchain platforms, Bitcoin. That sets the stage for an examination of transaction structure, validation, and flow, from creation to registration in the ledger and structure of the blocks, the Nakamoto consensus, and finally forks. From there, you’ll experience a deep dive into Ethereum; including the concepts of Gas and Message, smart contracts and the Ethereum virtual machine. From there, you’ll learn about the Ethereum consensus protocol, Ethereum Casper, and the Ethereum Proof-of-Stake algorithm. You’ll then see how blockchain can be connected to a distributed system, followed by a demonstration of how you can model a distributed system using Blockly4SoS and Kilobots. The concluding chapters offer a practical example that combines distributed systems with blockchain technology. </p><p>After reading this book, you will understand how to implement blockchain technology in a distributed system and be able to leverage this knowledge in your own projects. </p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Learn the concept of blockchains by way of a practical example  </li><li>Grasp the connection between distributed systems and blockchain technology</li><li>Learn the design of blockchain with hyperledger fabric</li><li>Learn the design of cyber-physical systems in a distributed environment </li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Who Is This Book For</b></p><p>Developers who are enthusiastic about the design and implementation of distributed systems.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p></p><p></p><p>Technology is constantly evolving, and blockchain is taking development to new places, as mobile did a decade ago – and Ethereum is the leading platform for creating this new wave of applications. This book reveals everything you need to create a robust decentralized application (more commonly known as DApp). Unlike other books on the topic, this one focuses on the web application layer, and guides you in creating great experiences on top of the Ethereum blockchain. You’ll review the challenges and differences involved in developing DApps as opposed to traditional web applications. </p>After a brief introduction to blockchain history and Ethereum in particular, you’ll jump directly into building a sample decentralized application, to familiarize yourself with all the moving pieces. This book offers specific chapters on querying and rendering data from the blockchain, reacting to events, interacting with user accounts, sending transactions, managing gas, handling confirmations and reorganizations, and more. You will also find a chapter dedicated to Solidity that will give you the necessary means to understand and even build your own smart contracts. <p></p><p>Other important topics covered include building backend servers that act as indexing layers, and managing storage efficiently with solutions like the interplanetary file system, or IPFS. Last but not least, you will find chapters that examine the biggest problems on Ethereum today: onboarding and scalability. These include the state of the art of the available strategies to tackle them, such as meta-transactions, smart accounts, ENS, state channels, sidechains, and more.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p>\n<ul><li>Connect to the blockchain from the browser and send transactions from      client-side</li><li>Build a web app that provides a read-only interface to a blockchain      contract <br/></li><li>Create a wallet interface for arbitrary fungible tokens, displaying the      user’s balance and allowing for simple transfers to other addresses</li><li>Develop a web app that stores large blobs of data off-chain, and keeps a      reference to it on-chain (e.g. avatars, long text descriptions)</li><li>Produce a web app that relies on a centralized server for indexing      on-chain information to be presented to the user </li></ul> <p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>Web developers focused on client-side applications, with knowledge of JavaScript and HTML/CSS. You do not need any prior knowledge of Blockchain, Ethereum, or cryptocurrency. <p></p>\n<p> </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><b>From the cofounder of the longest-running Bitcoin exchange comes a compelling argument for how this digital currency will transform the global economy—and how it can work for you.</b><br/><br/>\nA financial revolution is materializing before our eyes. The way individuals, organizations, and governments conduct transactions—from purchasing a book online to acquiring major corporations to delivering billions in financial aid—will look vastly different in the near future. Bitcoin is spearheading this revolution and may be the best investment opportunity of our time, yet most people have yet to understand its promise.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn this book, Bobby C. Lee, one of the earliest, most successful pioneers in the cryptocurrency space, debunks myths and dispels fears that surround Bitcoin, arguing that this rational, logical system is superior to traditional monetary systems. He cites signs of Bitcoin’s widening acceptance: a growing community of users worldwide and multiple initiatives for investing in and holding bitcoin among major financial services organizations and institutional investors who control trillions in assets.<br/>\n<br/>\nLee offers a primer on the best strategies for investing in this digital currency, the value of which will only continue to grow. He discusses the pros and cons, and covers the complicated yet more profitable method of acquiring bitcoin, mining. He offers predictions for the future, including price, trajectory, use, and participation in the larger economy—as well as developments in regulation, technology, business, and society.<br/>\n<br/>\nInvest in the promise of Bitcoin today.<br/>\n<br/>\n\n  </span>",

Libertarian technologists who believed bitcoin would be the foundation of a new world order saw the moment as an apotheosis. Everyone else saw a bubble. Everyone else was right, and the bubble burst. But bitcoin survived, and the battle for its soul rages on.</p><p><i>Kings of Crypto</i> drops us into the unfolding drama, tracing the rise, fall, and rebirth of cryptocurrency through the experiences of major players across the globe. We follow Silicon Valley entrepreneur Brian Armstrong and the turbulent rocket ride of his startup, Coinbase, as he tries to take bitcoin mainstream while fighting off hackers, thieves, and zealots. Author Jeff John Roberts keenly observes the world of virtual currencies and what happens when startups try to disrupt the world of high finance. Clear explanations of crypto technology are woven into an amazing landscape full of meme-fueled startup hijinks, hacking (so much hacking!), shady investors, government investigations, billionaire bros and their Lambos, and closed-door meetings with Jamie Dimon.</p><p>This is the surprising story of the origins of cryptocurrency and how it is changing money forever.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><b><em>The Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin</em></b> covers all aspects\nof the Bitcoin phenomenon, explaining how virtual currency works,\nhow it differs from and compares to traditional currency, the\nhistory of Bitcoin, how to purchase and pay with bitcoins, where\nand how one can obtain and manage a Bitcoin wallet, how to become a\nBitcoin minor, and more. In addition, this book presents\ninformation about competing virtual currencies, and compares them\nto Bitcoin. Readers will also learn to judge the relative value and\nsafety of the Bitcoin currency, and determine whether the rewards\noutweigh the risks.</p><p>Bitcoin is the virtual currency of the Internet, a distributed,\nworldwide, decentralized digital money. It's the most popular of\nseveral current cryptocurrencies, devised in 2009 by programmer\nSatoshi Nakamoto.(Although that's probably not his real\nname...)</p><p>The unit of currency in the Bitcoin system is called a\n<em>bitcoin</em>, or BTC. A bitcoin is not a physical currency, such\nas a dollar bill or nickel, but rather just a number associated\nwith a Bitcoin Address. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is\nnot issued from or managed by any central government bank or\norganization. With Bitcoin, users become their own banks –\nand assume all the risks inherent in that proposal. As such, the\nvalue of a bitcoin is not pegged to any traditional real-world\ncurrency. Over the currency's relatively short life, the dollar\nvalue of a bitcoin has fluctuated from 14 cents (actually, zero at\ninception) to more than $1,2000. (Today a bitcoin is worth\napproximately 800 US dollars.)</p><p>Bitcoin exists on a peer-to-peer network, much like BitTorrent.\nUsers on the P2P network, called <em>miners</em>, enable their PCs to\nbe used to host and manage bitcoin transactions. To use Bitcoin, a\nuser must sign up with an online wallet service, through which all\ntransactions are managed. This digital wallet is typically stored\non the P2P servers, with all transactions secured via public-key\nencryption. The public key is used to encode all payments, which\ncan then be retrieved only with the use of the user's private\nkey.</p><p>One can earn bitcoins by providing goods or services to other\nusers or by participating in the mining process. Users can also\npurchase bitcoins with traditional currency from one of several\nBitcoin Exchanges. Bitcoins can then be spent on other goods and\nservices available over the Internet.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><span><span><p><b>The definitive pioneering blueprint covering the what, why and how of the blockchain.</b> </p><p>Blockchains are new technology layers that rewire the Internet and threaten to side-step older legacy constructs and centrally served businesses. At its core, a blockchain injects trust into the network, cutting off some intermediaries from serving that function and creatively disrupting how they operate. Metaphorically, blockchains are the ultimate non-stop computers. Once launched, they never go down, and offer an incredible amount of resiliency, making them dependable and attractive for running a new generation of decentralized services and software applications. </p><p><i>The Business Blockchain</i> charts new territory in advancing our understanding of the blockchain by unpacking its elements like no other before. William Mougayar anticipates a future that consists of thousands, if not millions of blockchains that will enable not only frictionless value exchange, but also a new flow of value, redefining roles, relationships, power and governance. In this book, Mougayar makes two other strategic assertions. First, the blockchain has polymorphic characteristics; its application will result in a multiplicity of effects. Second, we shouldn’t ask ourselves what problems the blockchain solves, because that gives us a narrow view on its potential. Rather, we should imagine new opportunities, and tackle even more ambitious problems that cross organizational, regulatory and mental boundaries. </p><p>Drawing on 34 years of technology industry experience as an executive, analyst, consultant, entrepreneur, startup mentor, author, blogger, educator, thought leader and investor, William Mougayar describes a future that is influenced by fundamental shifts brought by blockchain technology as the catalyst for change. William Mougayar has been described as the most sophisticated blockchain business thinker. He is a blockchain industry insider whose work has already shaped and influenced the understanding of blockchain for people around the world, via his generous blogging and rigorous research insights. He is a direct participant in the crypto-technology market, working alongside startups, entrepreneurs, pioneers, leaders, innovators, creators, enterprise executives and practitioners; in addition to being an investor, advisor, and board member in some of the leading organizations in this space, such as the Ethereum Foundation, OpenBazaar and Coin Center.</p><p>Just as the Internet created new possibilities that we didn’t foresee in its early years, the blockchain will give rise to new business models and ideas that may still be invisible. Following an engaging Foreword by Vitalik Buterin, this book is organized along these 7 chapters:</p><p>1. What is the Blockchain?</p><p>2. How Blockchain Trust Infiltrates</p><p>3. Obstacles, Challenges &amp; Mental Blocks</p><p>4. Blockchain in Financial Services</p><p>5. Lighthouse Industries &amp; New Intermediaries</p><p>6. Implementing Blockchain Technology</p><p>7. Decentralization as the Way Forward</p><p><i>The Business Blockchain</i> is an invitation for technologists to better understand the business potential of the blockchain, and for business minded people to grasp the many facets of blockchain technology. This book teaches you how to think about the blockchain.</p></span></span></span></span></span>",

In a business context, blockchain can level the playing field between small and large organisations in several ways: Exact copies of the immutable, time-stamped data is held by all parties, all transactions can be viewed in real time, data blocks are cryptographically linked, all raw materials are traceable and smart contracts ensure no middle-men, ease of audit and reduced friction. The trust, transparency, security, quality and reduced costs of blockchain make it a game-changing technology that crosses sectors, industries and borders with ease. Even though the technologies are ready for adoption, businesses remain largely unaware of their full potential and effective implementation. End users require accurate and up-to-date information on the practical applications of blockchain — <i>Commercializing Blockchain</i> provides it.</p><p>A practical and easy-to-understand guide to blockchain, this timely book illustrates how this revolutionary technology can be used to transform governments, businesses, enterprises and entire communities. The author draws from his experience with global retailers, global technology companies, UCL Centre for Blockchain technologies, the government of the UK, Retail Blockchain Consortium and many other sources to present real-world case studies on the use and benefits of blockchain.

			"description": "<span><p><b>Discover how blockchain will facilitate a new currency that will transcend space and time</b><b> </b></p><p>Largely inspired by <i>The Denationalization of Money</i> by Fredrich Hayek, <i>Money Without Boundaries’</i> ideological foundation is also inspired by economists and thought leaders like Milton Friedman and Irving Fisher, advancements in capital markets over the past 50 years, and the convergence of old and new technologies. Author Thomas J. Anderson explains how blockchain acts as the filter and the glue, making it all possible. </p><p>Compared with other currencies, blockchain-managed money markets are more straightforward and transparent. It is easier to monitor, understand, and assess the quality of their \"full-faith and credit.\" <i>Money Without Boundaries</i> shows how not only money, but also the process of borrowing and lending, will evolve to be conducted in a 100% trusted, secure, transparent, open architecture environment. Anderson begins with a history of money and discusses the rise of cryptocurrency, concluding with a comparison of decentralized money markets to all other alternatives. </p><p><i>Money without Boundaries:</i></p><p>• Demonstrates how blockchain technology allows full transparency</p><p>• Explains how blockchain makes it possible for money to be fully commoditized</p><p>• Explains how this fully market-based, decentralized, self-regulating system has vast implications throughout the global financial system</p><p>• Shows how everyone will benefit when they have the opportunity to compete on “full faith in credit”</p><p>If you are interested in cryptocurrency, money, monetary theory, or understanding how the applied uses of blockchain technology will change your everyday life, this is essential reading.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Blockchains have many uses beyond cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. These shared, distributed ledgers also enable businesses to record transactions between parties in an efficient, verifiable, and permanent manner—unlike traditional methods. Using a blockchain in business can still pose numerous challenges, however. This ebook explains how developers can establish a blockchain network to handle business-to-business transactions while maintaining privacy and confidentiality.</p><p>Members of IBM’s global blockchain team show you how to start using these open, distributed ledgers to add value to your business networks. Unlike simple ledgers and contracts, blockchains offer irrefutable proof that all parties involved in a transaction agree to the details—creating a source of truth that today’s conventional business-to-business systems lack.</p><p>You’ll learn:</p><ul><li>How blockchains for business provide a shared, distributed ledger with smart contracts</li><li>How to identify and implement the scenarios for which blockchain is most suited</li><li>What developers need to know about enterprise blockchain</li><li>The important design and architectural considerations when building a blockchain-based platform</li><li>How chaincode encapsulates business logic to define assets and the terms of transactions</li><li>How to implement a blockchain application based on a commercial paper case study</li><li>What the future holds for blockchain</li></ul></div></span>",

The author discusses the various legal and compliance issues related to physician employment, such as anti-self referral and anti-kickback issues, and examines how to resolve disputes through arbitration or mediation. The author also outlines the pros and cons of various partnership arrangements. </p><p/><p>After you have finished this book, you will be able to ask meaningful questions of legal and accounting counsel, do a preliminary review and analysis of the agreement offered, and even compare a prospective employer’s contract to other standard agreements without endangering confidentiality agreements. You will be able to design standard text, saving time and money on legal fees by having counsel review and add the final touches to contract drafts instead of starting from scratch. With proper planning and a clear understanding of both short- and long-term objectives, you can move into the future and take advantage of opportunities in the current healthcare revolution.</p><p/></span>",

This book explains how finance and economics work today, and how the convergence of various technologies related to the financial sector can help us find solutions to problems, such as excessive debt creation, banks getting too big to fail, and shadow banking. <i>The Blockchain Alternative</i> offers sensible corrections to outdated and incorrect dogmas, such as the efficient markets hypothesis and rational expectations theory. You'll also be introduced to universal basic income, the consequences of going cashless, why complexity economics needs to be understood and what kinds of tools and theories you'll need to redefine the existing definition of capitalism.</p><p>While the book does discuss technologies and methods that are primed for our future, a number of references are made to economic history and the works of great thinkers from a different era. You'll see how the blockchain can be used to deploy solutions that were devised in the past, but which can serve as the antidote to our current economic malaises. You'll discover that what is required today is not an adaptation of the old theories, but a new methodology that is suited to this new era. Without undertaking such an endeavor, one will always be burdened with a definition of capitalism that is out of kilter with the evolution of our digital humanity.</p><p>What would this mean to monetary and fiscal policy, market structure and our current understanding of economics? More importantly would we need to change our current understanding of capitalism? And if we were to change our perceptions, what would the future version look like? This book answers these questions, and analyses some of the most pertinent issues of our generation.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Examine fractional banking, debt, and the financialization of assets</p></li><li><p>Gain a firm understanding of the \"too big to fail\" theory, smart contracts, and Fintech</p></li><li><p>Review economics and agent-based modelling</p></li><li><p>Use the blockchain and complexity economics to rethink economics and capitalistic systems</p></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>The primary audience is bankers and other finance professionals, policy makers, and students of finance and economics. The secondary audience is anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the current financial system, the blockchain, and the future of capitalism.</p></span>",

It evaluates elements of the different contracts that engineers commonly encounter, such as employee and associated consulting agreements and contracts involved in construction and government. </p><p>Approaching intellectual property from a contract perspective, this reference focuses on the many different types of patents and their role in commerce. It touches on the application of trademarks and recent developments in the use of copyright as a form of contract and explains the process of obtaining patents, including the rationale for investing in them. Ethical standards receive special attention, which includes a review of several prominent professional codes of ethics and conduct for both organizations and individual engineers, particularly officers and higher-level managers.</p></span>",

Until now, these strategies were the exclusive purview of institutions and the superwealthy, but today any informed investor can play the same game.</p><p>A rainbow of investment options—timber, start-ups, master limited partnerships (MLPs), hedged strategies, managed futures, infrastructure, peer-to-peer lending, farmland, and dozens of other nontraditional strategies—can provide dramatically better gains, with less total risk, than the standard choices. In <em>The Alternative Answer</em>, Bob Rice, Bloomberg TV's Alternative Investments Editor, leads an entertaining and easy- to-understand tour of this world, and suggests specific alternative investments for all four key \"jobs\" of a portfolio: safely generating more current income, decreasing risks of economic shocks, significantly increasing long-term profits, and protecting purchasing power over time.</p><p>Regardless of experience or net worth, readers will learn exactly how to substantially improve investment performance—in the same way that the world's best investors already do. Stocks and bonds alone aren't nearly enough. Investors need an alternative answer and now they have it.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span>\n    PEOPLE IN ORGANIZATIONs of all types-public and private, large and small-have for years had to wrestle with the formidable challenge of successfully planning and implementing changes in how they do business. Today, the demand for faster approaches is increasing across a broad spectrum of organizations in business and society, as they are faced daily with an array of change mandates-new business strategy development and deployment, merger and acquisition integration, work re-design, community organizing, and more. Traditional command and control structures and processes no longer enable and mobilize people in organizations-the rapid rate of change in the environment demands new and different ways for organizations to respond.<br/>Whole-Scale Change: Unleashing the Magic in Organizations combines systems theory and practical methodology to offer a proven, flexible approach that leads to aligned action by hundreds, even thousands of people-and creates powerful processes for change. Shattering the old paradigm about how long it takes organizations to change, the book shows how to rapidly engage the whole system in meeting organizational agility and flexibility demands. It offers adaptable, repeatable strategies for different settings and convening issues through the authors' unique Whole-Scale approach-which has been successfully applied in diverse businesses and industries, the service sector, health care, education, government, other nonprofits, and communities throughout the world.<br/>Imagine everyone in your organization pulling in the same direction, everyone with the same information, acting quickly to solve the problems and confront the issues facing your organization. Whole-Scale Change provides not only the theories and principles underlying the approach, but also the practical methods, tools, and road maps for unleashing the energy and combining the power and wisdom of all the people in an organization.\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span>\n    A new movement is afoot that promises to save the world by applying the magic of the market to the challenges of social change. But in this hard-hitting, controversial exposé, Michael Edwards shows that business is ill-equipped to attack the causes of poverty, inequality, violence, and discrimination. Achieving fundamental social transformation requires cooperation rather than competition, collective action more than individual effort, and support for long-term, systemic solutions instead of immediate results. With a vested interest in the status quo, business can promise only limited advances: small change. It's time to turn away from the false promise of the market and reassert the independence of global citizen action.<br/>\n  </span>",

Written by CNBC contributor Brian Kelly, this book goes beyond Bitcoin 101 to explain how this transformative technology is about to change the world. Digital currency is thrown into perspective against the history of payment systems and its own evolution, as readers are invited to explore the ways in which this technology is already changing the way business gets done. Readers gain insight into the mechanisms behind Bitcoin, and an expert perspective on digital currency's effect on the future of money and the economic implications of the Bitcoin revolution.</p><p>In the same way that e-mail changed the way we transfer information, the decentralized Bitcoin network is about to revolutionize the business world, the legal profession, and even the role of the government. <em>The Bitcoin Big Bang</em> dives head first into this paradigm shift, allowing readers to:</p><li><p>Explore the origins of digital currency</p></li><li><p>Learn the history and evolution of payment systems</p></li><li><p>Discover how the Bitcoin network is facilitating free and instant transfer of value</p></li><li><p>Understand the mining of Bitcoin, and how to invest</p></li><p>The digital currency revolution has implications that spread far beyond the finance industry. Anyone who exchanges payment for goods and services is on the cusp of the next big push in societal evolution, and only an understanding of the technology and a clear knowledge of the systems and behaviors at play can fully prepare us for the changes to come. <em>The Bitcoin Big Bang</em> is the go-to guide, helping those who use money use it better.</p></span></span></span>",

Pat McLagan draws on her thirty years of experience consulting on change projects worldwide to outline the beliefs, character traits, and actions that will enable anyone to welcome change and take advantage of it rather than fear and resist it.<br/><br/>Taking a conversational approach to a serious subject, she uses stories, examples, and illustrations to drive home the message that everybody in an organization has the power to make changes for the better. And she includes questionnaires throughout the book that enable readers to evaluate how ready they are to make the most of change.<br/><br/>Change is happening all around us, both planned and unplanned. How we react to change determines personal success and self-esteem, and ultimately the success of the entire organization.

Not only does it provide an effective option for the provision of energy services from the technical point of view, but it is based on resources that can be utilized on a sustainable basis all around the globe. In addition, the benefits accrued go beyond energy provision, creating unique opportunities for regional development. Today, biomass is seen as one of the most promising renewable sources of modern energy services in the medium term. Know-how and experiences from different countries pave the way to further development of bioenergy systems.<br/><br/><i>Bioenergy: Realising the Potential</i> integrates the key technical, policy and economic issues surrounding bioenergy projects in industrialised and developing countries, with a critical focus on four major topics: <br/><br/>• The biomass resource availability and potential <br/>• The institutions and markets development<br/>• Technical and economic enhancements <br/>• Successful examples from Europe and developing countries</span>",
