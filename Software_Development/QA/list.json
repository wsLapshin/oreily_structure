			"description": "<span><div><p>The office isn't as essential as it used to be. Flexible working hours and distributed teams are replacing decades of on-site, open-plan office culture. Wherever you work from nowadays, your colleagues are likely to be somewhere else. No more whiteboards. No more water coolers. And certainly no Ping-Pong. So how can you organize yourself, ship software, communicate, and be impactful as part of a globally distributed workforce? We'll show you how. It's time to adopt a brand new mindset. Remote working is here to stay. Come and join us.</p><p>Remote working is on the rise. Whether or not we are remote workers, it is likely we are all part of a global workforce. We need to learn to interact remotely, because we are all remote from someone in some way. Rather than simply simulating the way we'd usually work together via digital means, we have to learn new communication skills and adopt a different mindset in order to work remotely effectively, efficiently, and, most importantly, healthily.</p><p>We'll start by getting you set up with the right equipment and habits. Then, we'll learn the mindset of treating everyone as remote, and conquer both synchronous and asynchronous communication. You'll learn how to produce amazing artifacts, how to communicate clearly, and how to manage yourself and your teams. Then we'll look at the bigger picture: from measuring the remote readiness of your workplace, to creating a handbook for your team, to exploring remote-first culture and tackling burnout and mental well-being.</p><p>Fundamentally we'll see that adopting a remote-working mindset can do wonders for our organization, our effectiveness, and our impact in our careers. It can even create a more diverse and inclusive industry for us all to work in.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? The remote future is now. Be a part of it.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>There are no prerequisites to reading this book, other than having had some experience of working in the software industry and a healthy curiosity.</p></div></span>",

Explore some of the most cutting-edge databases available - from a traditional relational database to newer NoSQL approaches - and make informed decisions about challenging data storage problems. This is the only comprehensive guide to the world of NoSQL databases, with in-depth practical and conceptual introductions to seven different technologies: Redis, Neo4J, CouchDB, MongoDB, HBase, Postgres, and DynamoDB. This second edition includes a new chapter on DynamoDB and updated content for each chapter.</p><p>While relational databases such as MySQL remain as relevant as ever, the alternative, NoSQL paradigm has opened up new horizons in performance and scalability and changed the way we approach data-centric problems. This book presents the essential concepts behind each database alongside hands-on examples that make each technology come alive.</p><p>With each database, tackle a real-world problem that highlights the concepts and features that make it shine. Along the way, explore five database models - relational, key/value, columnar, document, and graph - from the perspective of challenges faced by real applications. Learn how MongoDB and CouchDB are strikingly different, make your applications faster with Redis and more connected with Neo4J, build a cluster of HBase servers using cloud services such as Amazon's Elastic MapReduce, and more. This new edition brings a brand new chapter on DynamoDB, updated code samples and exercises, and a more up-to-date account of each database's feature set.</p><p>Whether you're a programmer building the next big thing, a data scientist seeking solutions to thorny problems, or a technology enthusiast venturing into new territory, you will find something to inspire you in this book.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p>You'll need a *nix shell (Mac OS or Linux preferred, Windows users will need Cygwin), Java 6 (or greater), and Ruby 1.8.7 (or greater).

This definitive guide from RSpec's lead developer shows you how to use RSpec to drive more maintainable designs, specify and document expected behavior, and prevent regressions during refactoring. Build a project using RSpec to design, describe, and test the behavior of your code. Whether you're new to automated tests or have been using them for years, this book will help you write more effective tests.</p><p>RSpec has been downloaded more than 100 million times and has inspired countless test frameworks in other languages. Use this influential Ruby testing framework to iteratively develop a project with the confidence that comes from well-tested code. This book guides you through creating a Ruby project with RSpec, and explores the individual components in detail.</p><p>Start by learning the basics of installing and using RSpec. Then build a real-world JSON API, using RSpec throughout the process to drive a BDD-style outside-in workflow. Apply an effective test strategy to write fast, robust tests that support evolutionary design through refactoring. The rest of the book provides the definitive guide to RSpec's components. Use rspec-core's metadata to slice and dice your spec suite. Dig into rspec-expectations' matchers: compose them in flexible ways, specify expected outcomes with precision, and diagnose problems quickly with the help of good failure messages. Write fast, isolated tests with rspec-mocks' test doubles while pushing your code toward simpler interfaces.</p><p>The authors, with a combined 20 years of automated testing experience, share testing wisdom that will lead to a fun, productive testing experience.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>To follow along with the book, you'll need Ruby 2.2+. The book will guide you through installing RSpec 3 and setting up a new project to use it.</p></div></span>",

Whether you're building an airline schedule or planning routes for a trucking company, Prolog has the tools you need. You don't have to struggle through thousands of pages of sample programs. This guide to Prolog will quickly ramp you up on the basic Prolog techniques you'll need to solve the representative logical problems that Prolog is famous for.</p><p>Instead of working through dozens of fragmented code snippets written for different dialogs of Prolog, you can learn Prolog from a unified guide. You will start with the basics, defining the facts and inferences your programs will need to function. Then, you'll learn the techniques to tie those facts together. You'll finish off the basics by working through iconic problems like the map coloring problem. You'll break into recursive solutions with the eight queens problem as you learn to explore logical problems requiring recursion and fixed dimensions.</p><p>Once you've picked up the basics, you'll get right into the problem domains that made Prolog famous. You'll navigate graphs to compute a working path, or even evaluate paths with the least distance or fastest times. You'll not only learn what directed graphs are, but when to apply them. You'll also get to use Prolog to solve scheduling problems. The basic algorithm will give you the tools to schedule a sports league tournament with special constraints.</p><p>Don't settle for fragments of the big picture. Demand a consolidated approach that guides you through the process from beginning to end. Whether you're learning logic programming to open up career possibilities or to excel in a class, you need this book.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The examples in this book are based on SWI Prolog, one of the industry leading compilers.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>How do successful agile teams deliver\nbug-free, maintainable software—iteration after iteration?\nThe answer is: By seamlessly combining development and testing. On\nsuch teams, the developers write testable code that enables them to\nverify it using various types of automated tests. This approach\nkeeps regressions at bay and prevents “testing\ncrunches”—which otherwise may occur near the end of an\niteration—from ever happening. Writing testable code,\nhowever, is often difficult, because it requires knowledge and\nskills that cut across multiple disciplines.</p><p>In <em><b>Developer Testing,</b></em> leading\ntest expert and mentor Alexander Tarlinder presents concise,\nfocused guidance for making new and legacy code far more testable.\nTarlinder helps you answer questions like: <em>When have I tested\nthis enough? How many tests do I need to write? What should my\ntests verify?</em> You’ll learn how to design for testability\nand utilize techniques like refactoring, dependency breaking, unit\ntesting, data-driven testing, and test-driven development to\nachieve the highest possible confidence in your software.

Rather than designing all tests in advance, explorers design and execute small, rapid experiments, using what they learned from the last little experiment to inform the next. Learn essential skills of a master explorer, including how to analyze software to discover key points of vulnerability, how to design experiments on the fly, how to hone your observation skills, and how to focus your efforts.<br/><br/>Software is full of surprises. No matter how careful or skilled you are, when you create software it can behave differently than you intended. Exploratory testing mitigates those risks. <br/><br/>Part 1 introduces the core, essential skills of a master explorer. You'll learn to craft charters to guide your exploration, to observe what's really happening (hint: it's harder than it sounds), to identify interesting variations, and to determine what expected behavior should be when exercising software in unexpected ways. <br/><br/>Part 2 builds on that foundation. You'll learn how to explore by varying interactions, sequences, data, timing, and configurations. Along the way you'll see how to incorporate analysis techniques like state modeling, data modeling, and defining context diagrams into your explorer's arsenal. <br/><br/>Part 3 brings the techniques back into the context of a software project. You'll apply the skills and techniques in a variety of contexts and integrate exploration into the development cycle from the very beginning.<br/><br/>You can apply the techniques in this book to any kind of software. Whether you work on embedded systems, Web applications, desktop applications, APIs, or something else, you'll find this book contains a wealth of concrete and practical advice about exploring your software to discover its capabilities, limitations, and risks.</p></span>",

			"title": "Modern Asynchronous JavaScript",
			"description": "<span><div><p>JavaScript today must interact with data-intensive APIs and networks. The solution is a program that can work <i>asynchronously</i> instead of finishing tasks in order. In modern JavaScript, instead of callbacks you'll use promises to improve your application's performance and responsiveness. JavaScript features introduced in ES2020, ES2021, and ESNext like Promise.allSettled(), Promise.any(), and top-level await help you develop small, fast, low-profile applications. With the AbortController API, cancel a pending async request before it has completed. <i>Modern Asynchronous JavaScript</i> gives you an arsenal of tools to build programs that always respond to user requests, recover quickly from difficult conditions, and deliver maximum performance.</p><p>Applications today must work with information on remote servers, and users expect a quick response to complex interactions at all times, whether on a high-speed 5G cellular network or slow public WiFi. JavaScript provides developers with advanced tools to coordinate the asynchronous parts of their code efficiently and deliver responsive programs. Faster applications equal happier users, which is the promise of asynchronous JavaScript.</p><p>With <i>Modern Asynchronous JavaScript</i> you'll learn techniques for managing your async code. Features like ES2021 Promise.any() allow you to safeguard your async code from external issues that are out of your control like server downtime. You'll discover secret weapons like top-level await to initialize resources, define dependency paths dynamically, and load dependencies with a fallback implementation. You'll even learn to how to set a time limit for async requests and react if they take too long to complete.</p><p>Fast, reliable applications are a must in today's world, where users demand increasingly greater amounts of data on mobile devices. Asynchronous programming may require more cautious planning than synchronous programming but the outcome is rewarding. Asynchronous JavaScript allows you to write code that is nimble but reliable, leading to programs that load faster, respond quicker, and most importantly that you can trust to function properly.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You'll need an intermediate level of JavaScript programming skills and a browser that supports features from ES2020, ES2021, and ESNext.</p></div></span>",

It is by far the most common activity carried out by non-IT specialists. This book is designed to be a hands-on manual for non-testing specialists to plan and carry out an effective acceptance test of an information system. It provides a structured and step-by-step approach to effective acceptance testing and identifies ways of making the process as simple and cost-effective as possible. -- </p> 'As someone who started his career in testing by being told to leave the comfort of my data processing team to UAT a new system I know how hard it is to understand what is required of UA testers as to date there has been very little written or provided to help. This book comfortably fills the void that exists to help UA testers understand their role and the many tasks they have to undertake.'\nGeoff Thompson, Consultancy Director at Experimentus and Chair of the UK Testing Board -- \n\n'A UAT guide for users: that is a novel thought! This fills a gap in my bookshelf, a volume I wish I had years ago. It would have helped me to help the business. But more than that: it would have helped business users to help themselves, and see that UAT is more than just a necessary evil, but has clear purpose, methods, goals and skills. This is a step-by-step guide that is clear and praiseworthy. You never know, it could be a recruiting arm for professional testers in the future, brought in from the business.'\nPeter Morgan, Testing Practitioner -- \n\n'...a really excellent book; well written, carefully structured and in a format that makes it easy to read and understand the topic.

The ultimate goal of UAT is to validate that a\nsystem of products is of sufficient quality to be accepted by the\nusers and, ultimately, the sponsors. This Short Cut is unique in\nthat it views UAT through the concept that the user should be\nrepresented in every step of the software delivery\nlifecycle--including requirements, designs, testing, and\nmaintenance--so that the user community is prepared, and even\neager, to accept the software once it is completed.</p><p>Rob Cimperman offers an informal\nexplanation of testing, software development, and project\nmanagement to equip business testers with both theory and practical\nexamples, without the overwhelming details often associated with\nbooks written for \"professional\" testers. Rather than simply\nexplaining <em>what</em> to do, this resource is the only one that\nexplains <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> to do it by addressing this\nmarket segment in simple, actionable language. Throughout the\nauthor’s considerable experience coordinating UAT and guiding\nbusiness testers, he has learned precisely what testers do and do\nnot intuitively understand about the software development process.\n<em>UAT Defined</em> informs the reader about the unfamiliar\npolitical landscape they will encounter. Giving the UAT team the\ntools they need to comprehend the process on their own saves the IT\nstaff from having to explain test management from the beginning.\nThe result is a practice that increases productivity and eliminates\nthe costs associated with unnecessary mistakes, tedious rework, and\navoidable delays.</p><p>Chapter 1 Introduction</p><p>Chapter 2 Defining UAT–What It\nIs…and What It Is Not</p><p>Chapter 3 Test Planning–Setting the\nStage for UAT Success</p><p>Chapter 4 Building the\nTeam–Transforming Users into Testers</p><p>Chapter 5 Executing UAT–Tracking and\nReporting</p><p>Chapter 6 Mitigating Risk–Your\nPrimary Responsibility</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span>\n    Quickly access 50 tips for software test engineers using automated methods. The tips point to practices that save time and increase the accuracy and reliability of automated test techniques. Techniques that play well during demos of testing tools often are not the optimal techniques to apply on a running project. This book highlights those differences, helping you apply techniques that are repeatable and callable in professionally run software development projects. Emphasis is placed on creating tests that, while automated, are easily adapted as the software under construction evolves toward its final form. <p/>Techniques in the book are arranged into five categories: scripting, testing, the environment, running and logging of tests, and reviewing of the results. Every automation engineer sooner or later will face similar issues to the ones covered in these categories, and you will benefit from the simple and clear answers provided in this book. While the focus of the book is on the use of automated tools, the tips are not specific to any one vendor solution. The tips cover general issues that are faced no matter the specific tool, and are broadly applicable, often even to manual testing efforts.  <div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b><p/><p/><ul><li>Employ best-practices in automated test design<br/></li><li>Write test scripts that will easily be understood by others<br/></li><li>Choose the proper environment for running automated tests<br/></li><li>Avoid techniques that demo well, but do not scale in practice<br/></li><li>Manage tests effectively, including testing of test scripts themselves<br/></li><li>Know when to go beyond automation to employ manual methods instead<br/></li></ul><p/><p/><div><b>Who This Book Is For<br/></b></div><p>Software test engineers working with automated testing tools, and for developers working alongside testing teams to create software products.

Cucumber - the popular, open-source tool that helps teams communicate more effectively with their customers - now has a Java version, and our bestselling <i>Cucumber Book</i> has been updated to match. <i>The Cucumber for Java Book</i> has the same great advice about how to deliver rock-solid applications collaboratively, but with all code completely rewritten in Java. New chapters cover features unique to the Java version of Cucumber, and reflect insights from the Cucumber team since the original book was published.</p><p>Until now it's been difficult for teams developing Java applications to learn how to benefit from Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). This book changes all that by describing in detail how to use Cucumber to harness the power of plain language specifications in your development process.</p><p>In part 1, you'll discover how to use Cucumber's Gherkin DSL to describe the behavior your customers want from the system. You'll also learn how to write Java code that interprets those plain language specifications and checks them against your application. Part 2 guides you through a worked example, using Spring, MySQL, and Jetty. Enhanced chapters teach you how to use Selenium to drive your application and handle asynchronous Ajax calls, and new chapters cover Dependency Injection (DI) and advanced techniques to help keep your test suites fast. Part 3 shows you how to integrate Cucumber with your Continuous Integration (CI) system, work with a REST web service, and even use BDD with legacy applications.</p><p>Written by the creator of Cucumber and two of its most experienced users and contributors, <i>The Cucumber for Java Book</i> is an authoritative guide that will give you and your team all the knowledge you need to start using Cucumber with confidence.</p></div></span>",

It allows you to test all three types of mobile applications: native, hybrid, and mobile web. It allows you to run the automated tests on actual devices, emulators, and simulators. Today, when every mobile app is made on at least two platforms, iOS and Android, you need a tool that allows you to test across platforms.</p><p>Having two different frameworks for the same app increases the cost of the product and time to maintain it as well. Appium helps save this cost.</p><p>With mobile app growth exploding, mobile app automation is mainstream now. In this book, author Nishant Verma provides you with a firm grounding in the concepts of Appium while diving into how to set up appium &amp; Cucumber-jvm test automation framework, implement page object design pattern, automate gestures, test execution on emulators and physical devices, and implement continuous integration with Jenkins. The mobile app we have referenced in this book is Quikr because of its relatively lower learning curve to understand the application.

			"description": "<span><div><p>This book contains 25 short programs that will challenge your understanding of Go. Like any big project, the Go developers had to make some design decisions that at times seem surprising. This book uses those quirks as a teaching opportunity. By understanding the gaps in your knowledge, you'll become better at what you do. Some of the teasers are from the author's experience shipping bugs to production, and some from others doing the same. Teasers and puzzles are fun, and learning how to solve them can teach you to avoid programming mistakes and maybe even impress your colleagues and future employers.</p><p>Programmers love the Go (golang) programming language because of its efficiency and simple tooling. But that doesn't mean programming in Go is without challenges, like hidden dependencies that trip up the compiler and interesting string type conversions that differ from languages like Python. Work your way through 25 short brain teasers, and learn the nuances of Go in one of the most fun and creative ways around.</p><p>Challenge yourself and challenge your assumptions to gain a more in-depth understanding of integers, strings, Unicode, compiler behavior, and a variety of subtle programming gotchas that might otherwise trip you up. Just read a short program written in Go, try to guess the output, run the code yourself, and then go to the next page for an explanation of the solution. By working through these brain teasers, you'll tighten up your Go programming skills and have lots of fun at the same time.</p><p>Taken from real-world, programming problems, conference talks, and meetup quizzes, these brain teasers provide an effective learning tool that's as enjoyable as it is educational.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>This book assumes you know Go at some level and have experience programming with it.</p><p>*NOTE:* We use Go version 1.14.1 to run the code; the output might change in future versions.</p><p>You will need a working Go environment, you can download it from <a href=\"https://golang.org/dl\">https://golang.org/dl</a>. You will probably want a good IDE for Go, two of the most popular ones are Visual Studio Code and GoLand.</p></div></span>",

You need tooling and instincts to help you make the most out of what's available to you. Use this book as your guide to help you hone your skills and sculpt a Python project that can stand the test of time.</p><p>No matter your experience level or background, Python's batteries-included standard library and rich third-party ecosystem provide a solid foundation to build your projects on. With the right intuition and background knowledge, you can take advantage of all the power Python offers. Take a guided tour of some of Python's high points to craft a project that you can sustain and build on for a long time.</p><p>Run static analysis tools to detect and eliminate classes of bugs before you run code. Experiment with Python's concurrency model and develop patterns for using Python's thread and process abstractions to their full potential. Introduce yourself to Python's type hinting system: mypy. Download and run third-party Python packages and do so safely without compromising on security. Debug code using Python's built in debugger, and try procedures out in the interactive console. Run your code under new versions of the Python interpreter to unlock performance and usability improvements. All along the way, sharpen your Python instincts so you can keep your code clean and reduce the chance of bugs.</p><p>Mine Python for all you can by playing to its strengths and embracing patterns that harness its potential.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The books assumes you have some experience programming in any language (not necessarily Python).

			"description": "<span><p>Software Quality Assurance: Integrating Testing, Security, and Audit focuses on the importance of software quality and security. It defines various types of testing, recognizes factors that propose value to software quality, and provides theoretical and real-world scenarios that offer value and contribute quality to projects and applications. The practical synopsis on common testing tools helps readers who are in testing jobs or those interested in pursuing careers as testers. It also helps test leaders, test managers, and others who are involved in planning, estimating, executing, and maintaining software. The book is divided into four sections: The first section addresses the basic concepts of software quality, validation and verification, and audits. It covers the major areas of software management, software life cycle, and life cycle processes. The second section is about testing. It discusses test plans and strategy and introduces a step-by-step test design process along with a sample test case. It also examines what a tester or test lead needs to do before and during test execution and how to report after completing the test execution. The third section deals with security breaches and defects that may occur. It discusses documentation and classification of incidences as well as how to handle an occurrence. The fourth and final section provides examples of security issues along with a security policy document and addresses the planning aspects of an information audit. This section also discusses the definition, measurement, and metrics of reliability based on standards and quality metrics methodology CMM models. It discusses the ISO 15504 standard, CMMs, PSP, and TSP and includes an appendix containing a software process improvement sample document.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>We geeks love puzzles and solving them. The Python programming language is a simple one, but like all other languages it has quirks. This book uses those quirks as teaching opportunities via 30 simple Python programs that challenge your understanding of Python. The teasers will help you avoid mistakes, see gaps in your knowledge, and become better at what you do. Use these teasers to impress your co-workers or just to pass the time in those boring meetings. Teasers are fun!</p><p>At the beginning of each chapter I'll show you a short Python program and will ask you to guess the output. The possible answers can be:</p><ul><li>Syntax error</li><li>Exception</li><li>Hang</li><li>Some output (e.g. `[1 2 3]`)</li></ul><p>Here's how to approach the puzzles. Read through the code. Before moving on to the answer and the explanation, go ahead and guess the output. After guessing the output, run the code and see the output yourself. Finally proceed to read the solution and the explanation. The puzzles are short enough to solve on a coffee break, so carry them with you, have fun, and share them with co-workers.</p><p>People who make mistakes during the learning process learn better than people who don't. If you use this approach at work when fixing bugs, you'll find you enjoy bug hunting more and become a better developer after each bug you fix.</p><p>Many of these puzzles are from the author's lessons learned (and others) of shipping bugs to production. He often uses the puzzles as quizzes during conferences and meetups, and they tend to create a buzz of excitement.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><ul><li>You need to know Python at some level and have experience programming with it.</li><li>NOTE: The book uses Python version 3.8.2 to run the code; the output _could_ change in future versions.</li><li>You will need a working Python environment, you can download it from \"python.org\":<a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a>.</li><li>You will probably want a good IDE for python, two of the most popular ones are \"Visual Studio Code\":<a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a> and \"PyCharm\":<a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/\">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/</a>.</li></ul></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>This is the digital version of the printed book (Copyright\n© 2004).<br/>\n<br/>\nTesting is not a phase. Software developers should not simply throw\nsoftware over the wall to test engineers when the developers have\nfinished coding. A coordinated program of peer reviews and testing\nnot only supplements a good software development process, it\nsupports it.</p><p>A good testing life cycle begins during the\nrequirements elucidation phase of software development, and\nconcludes when the product is ready to install or ship following a\nsuccessful system test.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is no one true way to\ntest software; the best one can hope for is to possess a formal\ntesting process that fits the needs of the testers as well as those\nof the organization and its customers.</p><p>A formal test plan is more than an early\nstep in the software testing process—it's a vital part of\nyour software development life cycle. This book presents a series\nof tasks to help you develop a formal testing process model, as\nwell as the inputs and outputs associated with each task. These\ntasks include:</p><li><p>review of program plans</p></li><li><p>development of the formal test plan</p></li><li><p>creation of test documentation (test design, test cases, test\nsoftware, and test procedures)</p></li><li><p>acquisition of automated testing tools</p></li><li><p>test execution</p></li><li><p>updating the test documentation</p></li><li><p>tailoring the model for projects of all sizes</p></li><p>Whether you are an experienced test engineer\nlooking for ways to improve your testing process, a new test\nengineer hoping to learn how to perform a good testing process, a\nnewly assigned test manager or team leader who needs to learn more\nabout testing, or a process improvement leader, this book will help\nyou maximize your effectiveness.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><em>“This book fills a huge gap in our knowledge of\nsoftware testing. It does an excellent job describing how test\nautomation differs from other test activities, and clearly lays out\nwhat kind of skills and knowledge are needed to automate tests. The\nbook is essential reading for students of testing and a bible for\npractitioners.”</em><br/>\n—Jeff Offutt, Professor of Software Engineering, George Mason\nUniversity<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n\t\t\t<em>“This new book naturally expands upon its predecessor,\nAutomated Software Testing, and is the perfect reference for\nsoftware practitioners applying automated software testing to their\ndevelopment efforts. Mandatory reading for software testing\nprofessionals!”</em><br/>\n—Jeff Rashka, PMP, Coauthor of <em>Automated Software Testing\nand Quality Web Systems</em><br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\nTesting accounts for an increasingly large percentage of the time\nand cost of new software development. Using automated software\ntesting (AST), developers and software testers can optimize the\nsoftware testing lifecycle and thus reduce cost. As technologies\nand development grow increasingly complex, AST becomes even more\nindispensable.  This book builds on some of the proven\npractices and the automated testing lifecycle methodology (ATLM)\ndescribed in <em>Automated Software Testing</em> and provides a\nrenewed practical, start-to-finish guide to implementing AST\nsuccessfully.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\nIn <em><b>Implementing Automated Software Testing,</b></em> three\nleading experts explain AST in detail, systematically reviewing its\ncomponents, capabilities, and limitations. Drawing on their\nexperience deploying AST in both defense and commercial industry,\nthey walk you through the entire implementation\nprocess—identifying best practices, crucial success factors,\nand key pitfalls along with solutions for avoiding them. You will\nlearn how to:<br/></p><ul><li><p>    Make a realistic business case for AST, and\nuse it to drive your initiative</p></li><li><p>    Clarify your testing requirements and\ndevelop an automation strategy that reflects them</p></li><li><p>    Build efficient test environments and choose\nthe right automation tools and techniques for your environment</p></li><li><p>    Use proven metrics to continuously track\nyour progress and adjust accordingly</p></li></ul><p>Whether you’re a test professional, QA specialist, project\nmanager, or developer, this book can help you bring unprecedented\nefficiency to testing—and then use AST to improve your entire\ndevelopment lifecycle.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/></p></span>",

			"title": "Lean Six Sigma for the Office, 2nd Edition",
			"description": "<span><p><br>Historically, the integration of manufacturing methodologies into the office environment has proven to be problematic. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that process workflows tend to be globally dispersed and thus rely heavily on information technology. But in complex service systems that contain a mix of employees, consultants, and technology, standardized protocols have been shown to reduce cycle time and transactional cost as well as improve quality. The successful application of Lean methodologies to improve process workflows is an efficient way to simplify operations and prevent mistakes. </p>\n\n<p>In Lean Six Sigma for the Office , Six Sigma guru James Martin presents proven modifications that can be deployed in offices, particularly those offices involved with global operations. Making use of Kaizen and Six Sigma concepts, along with Lean manufacturing principles, this book instructs managers on how they can improve operational efficiency and increase customer satisfaction. </p>\n\n<p>The author brings experience gleaned from his application of these methodologies in a myriad of industries to create a practical and hands-on reference for the office environment. Using a detailed sequence of activities, including over 140 figures and tables as well as checklists and evaluation tools, he demonstrates how to realize the rapid improvement of office operations, and how to eliminate unnecessary tasks through value stream mapping (VSM). The book also emphasizes the importance of strategic alignment of Kaizen events and the impact of organizational culture on process improvement activities. Latter chapters in the book discuss key elements of a change model in the context of transitional improvements as they relate to the process owner and local work team. By applying the proven principles found in this book, effective and sustainable organizational change can be accomplished, efficiency can be improved, and mistakes can be eliminated.</p>\n\n<p>This 2nd edition provides insight into the new tools and methods Lean Six Sigma process improvement professionals need to improve customer experience and increase productivity within high transaction processes across complex information technology ecosystems. It is one-stop self-contained reference for the application of Lean Six Sigma methods enhanced by powerful approaches for process improvement in highly complex service processes. </p>\n\n<p>Several new leading-edge topics are integrated into this new edition, such as:<br>•\tThe \"voice of”  customers, suppliers, employees and partners<br>•\tDesign Thinking Alignment<br>•\tEcosystems in Information Technology <br>•\tMetadata Definition and Lineage<br>•\tInformation Quality Governance<br>•\tBig Data Collection and Analytics  <br>•\tMapping High Volume Transactions through Systems<br>•\tRobotic Process Automation Applications<br>•\tAutomating for Solution Sustainability<br>•\tGoverning Organizations<br>•\tData Privacy (General Data Protection Regulation)<br></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><em>A Practical Guide to Testing Object-Oriented Software</em>\nfocuses on the real-world issues that arise in planning and\nimplementing effective testing for object-oriented and\ncomponent-based software development. It shows how testing\nobject-oriented software differs from testing procedural software\nand highlights the unique challenges and opportunities inherent in\nobject-oriented software testing.</p><p>The authors reveal how object-oriented software development\nallows testing to be integrated into each stage of the\nprocess--from defining requirements to system\nintegration--resulting in a smoother development process and a\nhigher end quality. As they follow this process, they describe what\nto test at each stage as well as offer experienced-based testing\ntechniques.</p><p>You will find information on such important topics as:</p><ul><li><p>Testing analysis and design models, including selecting test\ncases to guide design inspections</p></li><li><p>Testing components, frameworks, and product lines</p></li><li><p>The testing challenges of inheritance and polymorphism</p></li><li><p>How to devise an effective testing strategy</p></li><li><p>Testing classes, including constructing a test driver and test\nsuites</p></li><li><p>Testing object interactions, covering sampling test cases,\noff-the-shelf components, protocol testing, and test patterns</p></li><li><p>Testing class hierarchies, featuring subclass test\nrequirements</p></li><li><p>Testing distributed objects, including threads, life cycle\ntesting, and Web server testing</p></li><li><p>Testing systems, with information on stress, life cycle, and\nperformance testing</p></li></ul><p>One comprehensive example runs throughout the book to\ndemonstrate testing techniques for each stage of development. In\naddition, the book highlights important questions that testers\nshould ask when faced with specific testing tasks.</p><p>The authors acknowledge that testing is often viewed as a\nnecessary evil, and that resources allocated to testing are often\nlimited. With that in mind, they present a valuable repertoire of\ntesting techniques from which you can choose those that fit your\nbudget, schedule, and needs.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201325640B04062001</p></span></span>",

Yet in today’s harried rush-to-market\ndevelopment environment, organizations must find a delicate balance\nbetween product release and product quality.</p><p>In <b><em>Critical Testing Processes</em></b>, the author distills\nknowledge gained from 20 years of testing experience into twelve\ncritical processes. These include highly visible processes by which\npeers and management judge competence, and mission-critical\nprocesses in which performance affects the company’s profits\nand reputation.</p><p>After each process is introduced, the author demonstrates its\nuse through an engaging case study. Instead of cumbersome\nregulations, this book provides checklists—lightweight,\nflexible tools for implementing process-oriented testing, gathering\nmetrics, and making incremental process changes. By demonstrating\ncritical processes in various organizational, operational, and\ntechnological contexts, this book shows readers how to:<br/></p><li><p>Handle recurrent tests efficiently and consistently</p></li><li><p>Develop a cohesive, cooperative team that sidesteps\nredundancies</p></li><li><p>Build a reputation for reliability through the effective\ncommunication of test results</p></li><li><p>Define the focus of tests for maximum customer satisfaction and\norganizational success</p></li><p>Because testing is a collaborative process with the\nparticipation of staff throughout the organization, the author\ndiscusses interpersonal and cultural issues in depth. This book\nalso devotes ample coverage to the often-overlooked areas of\nplanning and perfecting tests. Whatever your role in\ntesting—from test engineering to managing hundreds of test\nengineers—<b><em>Critical Testing Processes</em></b> will offer\nvaluable insights into what you do, why it’s important, and\nhow you can perform better.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201748681B04222003</p></span></span>",

			"title": "The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook",
			"description": "<span><span><span><p>Although Lean and Six Sigma appear to be quite different, when used together they have shown to deliver unprecedented improvements to quality and profitability. <strong>The Lean Six Sigma Black Belt Handbook: Tools and Methods for Process Acceleration</strong> explains how to integrate these seemingly dissimilar approaches to increase production speed while decreasing variations and costs in your organization.<br/><br/>Presenting problem-solving tools you can use to immediately determine the sources of the problems in your organization, the book is based on a recent survey that analyzed Six Sigma tools to determine which are the most beneficial. Although it focuses on the most commonly used tools, it also includes coverage of those used a minimum of two times on every five Six Sigma projects.<br/><br/>Filled with diagrams of the tools you’ll need, the book supplies a comprehensive framework to help you for organize and process the vast amount of information currently available about Lean, quality management, and continuous improvement process applications. It begins with an overview of Six Sigma, followed by little-known tips for using Lean Six Sigma (LSS) effectively. It examines the LSS quality system, its supporting organization, and the different roles involved.<br/><br/>Identifying the theories required to support a contemporary Lean system, the book describes the new skills and technologies that you need to master to be certified at the Lean Six Sigma Black Belt (LSSBB) level. It also covers the advanced non-statistical and statistical tools that are new to the LSSBB body of knowledge.<br/><br/>Presenting time-tested insights of a distinguished group of authors, the book provides the understanding required to select the solutions that best fit your organization's aim and　culture. It also includes exercises, worksheets, and templates you can easily customize to create your own handbook for continuous process improvement.<br/><br/>Designed to make the methodologies you choose easy to follow, the book will help Black Belts and Senseis better engage their employees, as well as provide an integrated and visual process management structure for reporting and sustaining continuous improvement breakthroughs and initiatives.<br/><br/></p></span></span></span>",

This book is divided into five broad parts. Part I introduces software testing in the broader context of software engineering and explores the qualities that testing aims to achieve or ascertain, as well as the lifecycle of software testing. Part II covers mathematical foundations of software testing, which include software specification, program correctness and verification, concepts of software dependability, and a software testing taxonomy.

We certainly have, and in <i>Cucumber Recipes</i> we'll show you how to apply our hard-won field experience to your own projects.  Once you've mastered the basics, this book will show you how to get the most out of Cucumber--from specific situations to advanced test-writing advice. With over forty practical recipes, you'll test desktop, web, mobile, and server applications across a variety of platforms. This book gives you tools that you can use today to automate any system that you encounter, and do it well.<br/><br/><i>The Cucumber Book</i> showed you how your team can work together to write <i>executable specifications</i>--documents that tell a clear story and also happen to be working test code.  We'll arm you with ready-rolled solutions to real-world problems: your tests will run faster, read more clearly, and work in any environment.<br/><br/>Our first tips will help you fit Cucumber into your workflow. Powerful filters will tame tables full of test data, transforming them into the format your application needs.  Custom output formatters will generate reports for any occasion.  Continuous Integration servers will run your Cucumber tests every time the code changes. Next, you'll find recipes tailored to the platform you're running on.  Ever wanted to know how to test a Grails app from Cucumber?  Need to put a Windows program through its paces?  How about a mobile app running on Android or iOS?  We'll show you how to do all of these.<br/><br/>Throughout the book, you'll see how to make Cucumber sing as you  interoperate with different platforms, languages, and environments. From embedded circuits to Python and PHP web apps, Cucumber has something for you.<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b><br/><br/>You'll need basic working knowledge of Cucumber and Ruby.  Individual recipes may have additional requirements; for example, a recipe on Windows automation might pull in an open source GUI driver.<br/><br/>We've written the recipes for compatibility with Ruby 1.9.3 and 1.8.7, plus Cucumber 1.1.4.  Other versions may work as well, but these are the ones we test with.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>This book is for everyone who needs to test the web. As a tester, you'll automate your tests. As a developer, you'll build more robust solutions. And as a team, you'll gain a vocabulary and a means to coordinate how to write and organize automated tests for the web. Follow the testing pyramid and level up your skills in user interface testing, integration testing, and unit testing. Your new skills will free you up to do other, more important things while letting the computer do the one thing it's really good at: quickly running thousands of repetitive tasks.<br/><br/>This book shows you how to do three things:<br/><br/><em> How to write really good automated tests for the web.<br/><br/></em> How to pick and choose the right ones.<br/><br/>* How to explain, coordinate, and share your efforts with others.<br/><br/>If you're a traditional software tester who has never written an automated test before, this is the perfect book for getting started. Together, we'll go through everything you'll need to start writing your own tests.<br/><br/>If you're a developer, but haven't thought much about testing, this book will show you how to move fast without breaking stuff. You'll test RESTful web services and legacy systems, and see how to organize your tests.<br/><br/>And if you're a team lead, this is the Rosetta Stone you've been looking for. This book will help you bridge that testing gap between your developers and your testers by giving your team a model to discuss automated testing, and most importantly, to coordinate their efforts.<br/><br/><i>The Way of the Web Tester</i> is packed with cartoons, graphics, best practices, war stories, plenty of humor, and hands-on tutorial exercises that will get you doing the right things, the right way.</p></span>",

Now, in <b><em>Quality Code:\nSoftware Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns,</em></b>\nStephen Vance builds on all that’s been learned about\ntest-driven development, helping you achieve unprecedented levels\nof first-time quality. Using real-world code examples, this guide\nintroduces patterns, principles, and more than two dozen detailed\ntechniques for testing any software system more fully, effectively,\nand painlessly. Vance presents a conceptual framework to help you\nfocus your efforts and design recommendations for improving\ntestability across the software lifecycle, and also provides\nhands-on guidance to simplify testing of the full spectrum of code\nconstructs. You’ll learn how to choose the best testing\ntechniques for every situation, from the most common scenarios to\nthreading. Two complete case studies put it all together, walking\nyou through testing a brand-new Java application and an untested\n“legacy” JavaScript jQuery plugin. Whether you’re\ndeveloping cutting-edge code for a new start-up, or maintaining an\nunruly old system, this guide will help you deliver exactly what\nyou need: quality code.</p><p>• Simplify unit testing of all your\ncode—and improve integration and system testing</p><p>• Delineate intent and implementation\nto promote more reliable and scalable testing</p><p>• Overcome confusion and\nmisunderstandings about the mechanics of writing tests</p><p>• Test “side effects,”\nbehavioral characteristics, and contextual constraints</p><p>• Understand subtle interactions\nbetween design and testability—and make them work for, not\nagainst, you</p><p>• Discover core principles that guide\nyour key testing decisions</p><p>• Explore testing getters/setters,\nstring handling, encapsulation, override variations, visibility,\nsingleton patterns, error conditions, and more</p><p>• Reproduce and test complex race\nconditions deterministically</p></span></span>",

Whittaker defines both\nin-the-small techniques for individual testers and in-the-large\ntechniques to supercharge test teams. He also introduces a hybrid\nstrategy for injecting exploratory concepts into traditional\nscripted testing. You’ll learn when to use each, and how to\nuse them all successfully.</p><p>Concise, entertaining, and actionable, this\nbook introduces robust techniques that have been used extensively\nby real testers on shipping software, illuminating their actual\nexperiences with these techniques, and the results they’ve\nachieved. Writing for testers, QA specialists, developers, program\nmanagers, and architects alike, Whittaker answers crucial questions\nsuch as:</p><p>•  Why do some bugs remain\ninvisible to automated testing--and how can I uncover them?</p><p>•  What techniques will help me\nconsistently discover and eliminate “show stopper”\nbugs?</p><p>•  How do I make manual testing\nmore effective--and less boring and unpleasant?</p><p>•  What’s the most\neffective high-level test strategy for each project?</p><p>•  Which inputs should I test\nwhen I can’t test them all?</p><p>•  Which test cases will provide\nthe best feature coverage?</p><p>•  How can I get better results\nby combining exploratory testing with traditional script or\nscenario-based testing?</p><p>•  How do I reflect feedback from\nthe development process, such as code changes?</p></span>",

The DFSS tool used is the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) process, which is also known as the House of Quality (HOQ). Although these are techniques reserved for the design of new products, the book illustrates how the HOQ helps translate exactly what customers specifically find important about your products. In addition, if customers are experiencing issues with that product, it helps map those issues and prioritizes the Critical to Quality (CTQ) parameters. Because the HOQs tie the Voice of the Customer to CTQs, it continues to connect to the product design and ends with manufacturing process variables. This linkage makes this idea and approach unique.</p><p>Stopping there may show that there is linkage between the customer and manufacturing process variables, but moving ahead, we must also connect the functions within the business that provides the product. The book helps define the key business function as three large business functions that must work as one cohesive and unified team. These functions are: commercial (sales and marketing), R&amp;D (product properties and services), and operations (product quality). Connecting these functions involves many colleagues, and a very effective communication process among the three is vital for the success of the product and customer satisfaction.</p><p>Understanding the voice of the customer is paramount—not doing so could lead to product performance issues and loss of market share. In addition, repeated customer dissatisfaction permeates internal workplace culture—employees begin to feel that they are producing products disconnected from end users’ needs and wants.</p></span>",

			"title": "Automated Unit Testing with ABAP: A Practical Approach",
			"description": "<span>Write automated unit tests for the ABAP language. This book teaches programmers using simple examples and metaphors and explains the underlying concepts of writing effective automated unit tests. Many, if not most, ABAP programmers learned their programming and testing skills before the ABAP development environment provided an automated unit testing facility.  <p><b><i>Automated Unit Testing with ABAP: A Practical Approach</i></b> offers hope and salvation to ABAP programmers who continue to toil with antiquated manual unit testing processes, taking them by the hand and lifting them out of that dungeon of despair with a modern and proven alternative. It begins by explaining how the xUnit family of automated testing frameworks provides a quick and effective means of insuring high-quality software. It then focuses on the ABAP Unit Testing Facility, the xUnit framework applicable specifically to the ABAP language, showing how it can be used to bring ABAP applications under automated testing control, from old legacy applications to those newly written.</p><p>Whereas xUnit testing has been widely accepted with developers writing in many other programming languages, it is an unfortunate fact in the ABAP community that many programmers still are unfamiliar with xUnit concepts and do not know how to begin implementing automated unit testing into their development process. This book demonstrates how to refactor programs so they become designed for testability, showing how to use process encapsulation and test isolation to facilitate automated testing, including a thorough explanation of test-driven development and the use of test doubles. The book:</p><p></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Shows how to write automated unit tests for ABAP</li><li>Instills ABAP programmers with the confidence to refactor poorly written code</li><li>Explains how an automated testing harness facilitates rapid software development</li><li>Teaches how to utilize test-driven development (TDD) with ABAP</li><li>Offers advice and tips on the best ways to write automated unit tests</li></ul><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b><br/></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Become familiar with the xUnit approach to testing</li><li>Know the ABAP statements that interfere with running automated unit tests and how to accommodate them</li><li>Understand what it means to isolate code for testing and how this is achieved</li><li>Gain the confidence to refactor poorly written code</li><li>Make ABAP programs designed for testability</li><li>Reap the benefits of spending less time manually unit testing ABAP programs</li><li>Use test-driven development (TDD) with ABAP programming</li><li>Use configurable test doubles in ABAP</li></ul><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></p>ABAP programmers who remain unfamiliar with the automated unit testing facility and those who already use it but want to improve their skill writing and using automated tests. The book addresses the reluctance and trepidation felt by procedural ABAP programmers who need to know some object-oriented concepts to use this facility, expands their horizons, and helps them step through the doorway leading to a different approach to program design.</span>",

			"description": "<span><p>One of the major discussions in the business world is: How do we get our human capital assets more engaged in the organization? Current Gallup Polls state that 85% of our employees are not engaged within their organizations. </p><i>\n</i><p>Employee Empowerment fully analyzes this workplace condition, which is a major concern for most CEOs. The solution proposed by this book is the introduction of the TLS (Theory of Constraints - Lean - Six Sigma) Continuum Empowerment model, which comprises three levels of empowerment – Management, Cross-Functional Team, and Individual. The first is the empowerment that comes from upper management to the organization as a whole. The second level is the empowerment that comes from the various cross-functional teams and the final level is from the individuals themselves through their ability to take ownership in the processes in which they are involved. The end solution in the book is that if we can get the human capital assets to take ownership of the processes (that is, empower the front-line employees), it will increase the level of engagement. If they become more engaged they will empower the organization at all levels to introduce sustainable change management to resolve problems within the organization. One of the tools of individual empowerment is the use of the Six Sigma toolbox.</p><p>This book makes the case that when human capital assets take ownership of the processes, then we have greater engagement, and thus a more empowered organization.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>\"In this book, I have found answers to key questions and\nmisconceptions about the relationship between Six Sigma and the\nCapability Maturity Model Integration [CMMI]....Among my key\ntakeaways is that the relationship between Six Sigma and CMMI\nexemplifies one of the principles of S4/IEE: CMMI provides process\ninfrastructure that is needed to support a successful Six Sigma\nstrategy.\"</p><p>\n—Forrest W. Breyfogle III, CEO, Smarter Solutions,\nInc.\n</p><p>\"Finally, a book that bridges the software and hardware process\ntool set. To date, there have been hardware and software engineers\nwho for one reason or another have not communicated their process\nmethods. And so, myths formed that convinced the hardware community\nthat CMMI was only for software and likewise convinced the software\ncommunity that Six Sigma was only for hardware. It is both\nrefreshing and thought provoking to dispel these myths.\"</p><p>\n—Jack Ferguson, Manager, SEI Appraisal Program, Software\nEngineering Institute\n</p><p>CMMI and Six Sigma represent two of the best-known process\nimprovement initiatives. Both are designed to enhance work quality\nand thereby produce business advantages for an organization. It's a\nmisconception that the two are in competition and cannot be\nimplemented simultaneously. Practitioners originally trained in\neither CMMI or Six Sigma are now finding that the two initiatives\nwork remarkably well together in the pursuit of their common\ngoal.</p><p><b><em>CMMI® and Six Sigma: Partners in Process\nImprovement</em></b> focuses on the synergistic, rather than\ncompetitive, implementation of CMMI and Six Sigma—with\nsynergy translating to \"faster, better, cheaper\" achievement of\nmission success. Topics range from formation of the value\nproposition to specific implementation tactics. The authors\nillustrate how not taking advantage of what both initiatives have\nto offer puts an organization at risk of sinking time, energy, and\nmoney into \"inventing\" a solution that already exists. Along the\nway they debunk a few myths about Six Sigma applications in\nsoftware.</p><p>While the authors concentrate on the interoperability of Six\nSigma and CMMI, they also recognize that organizations rarely\nimplement only these two initiatives. Accordingly, the discussion\nturns to the emerging realm of \"multimodel\" process improvement and\nstrategies and tactics that transcend models to help organizations\neffectively knit together a single unified internal process\nstandard.</p><p>Whether you work in the defense industry, for a commercial\norganization, or for a government agency—wherever quality and\nefficiency matter—you'll find this book to be a valuable\nresource for bridging process issues across domains and building an\nimprovement strategy that succeeds.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><i>User Interface Inspection Methods</i> succinctly covers five inspection methods: heuristic evaluation, perspective-based user interface inspection, cognitive walkthrough, pluralistic walkthrough, and formal usability inspections. </p><p>Heuristic evaluation is perhaps the best-known inspection method, requiring a group of evaluators to review a product against a set of general principles. The perspective-based user interface inspection is based on the principle that different perspectives will find different problems in a user interface. In the related persona-based inspection, colleagues assume the roles of personas and review the product based on the needs, background, tasks, and pain points of the different personas. The cognitive walkthrough focuses on ease of learning.</p><p>Most of the inspection methods do not require users; the main exception is the pluralistic walkthrough, in which a user is invited to provide feedback while members of a product team listen, observe the user, and ask questions. </p><p>After reading this book, you will be able to use these UI inspection methods with confidence and certainty.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>We live in a very different world from 1987 when Six Sigma was first introduced by Motorola, and from the early 2000s when the first books on Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma deployment appeared. How should one think about continuous improvement in a modern world? Is Lean Six Sigma the best approach to take for all problems, including large, complex, unstructured problems, such as climate change or the Millennial Development Goals? The authors argue that a different paradigm is needed to take continuous improvement to a new level in the world in which we now find ourselves. Snee and Hoerl refer to this paradigm as <i>Holistic Improvement</i>, and suggest Lean Six Sigma 2.0, the next version of Lean Six Sigma, as the best methodology based on this paradigm. Holistic improvement incorporates a diverse array of improvement methods, beyond Lean and Six Sigma, to ensure that organizations can apply the most relevant improvement method to a specific problem.</p><p><b>Leading Holistic Improvement with Lean Six Sigma 2.0</b> is the only book on the market that addresses the developments that have occurred in the last 15 years, and also provides a way to address these developments. These developments include the rapid growth of globalization, the recognition of the importance of large, complex, unstructured problems, the rise of Data Science as a discipline, and the growing importance of risk management in a world beset by terrorism and computer hacking of confidential information. This book includes learnings from Snee and Hoerl’s extensive use of Lean Six Sigma in improving process and organizational performance, and also their research on the topics that include two previous books and more than twenty published articles on the subject.</p></span>",

But unit testing has moved far beyond eXtreme Programming; it is now common in many different types of application development. Unit tests help ensure low-level code correctness, reduce software development cycle time, improve developer productivity, and produce more robust software.Until now, there was little documentation available on unit testing, and most sources addressed specific frameworks and specific languages, rather than explaining the use of unit testing as a language-independent, standalone development methodology. This invaluable new book covers the theory and background of unit test frameworks, offers step-by-step instruction in basic unit test development, provides useful code examples in both Java and C++, and includes details on some of the most commonly used frameworks today from the XUnit family, including JUnit for Java, CppUnit for C++, and NUnit for .NET.<i>Unit Test Frameworks</i> includes clear, concise, and detailed descriptions of:</p><ul><li>The theory and design of unit test frameworks</li><li>Examples of unit tests and frameworks</li><li>Different types of unit tests</li><li>Popular unit test frameworks</li><li>And more</li></ul>It also includes the complete source code for CppUnit for C++, and NUnit for .NET.</div></span></span>",

The recipes in the <em>Web Security Testing Cookbook</em> demonstrate how developers and testers can check for the most common web security issues, while conducting unit tests, regression tests, or exploratory tests. Unlike ad hoc security assessments, these recipes are repeatable, concise, and systematic-perfect for integrating into your regular test suite.<br/><br/>Recipes cover the basics from observing messages between clients and servers to multi-phase tests that script the login and execution of web application features. By the end of the book, you'll be able to build tests pinpointed at Ajax functions, as well as large multi-step tests for the usual suspects: cross-site scripting and injection attacks. This book helps you:</p><ul><li>Obtain, install, and configure useful-and free-security testing tools</li><li>Understand how your application communicates with users, so you can better simulate attacks in your tests</li><li>Choose from many different methods that simulate common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and manipulating hidden form fields</li><li>Make your tests repeatable by using the scripts and examples in the recipes as starting points for automated tests</li></ul><p>Don't live in dread of the midnight phone call telling you that your site has been hacked.

			"title": "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Lean Six Sigma",
			"description": "<span><p><i>The perfect prescription for any organization </i><br/><br/>Increasingly popular with large and mid-sized companies around the world, Lean Six Sigma is the new hybridization of Six Sigma and Lean methodologies, and there is no better approach for achieving operational excellence in an organization. But how do you implement Lean Six Sigma, and what does it entaill? <i>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Lean Six Sigma</i> answers this question with unprecedented clarity and turnkey elegance. Part one gives you all the background you need to understand Lean Six Sigma - what it is, where it came from, what it has done for so many organizations and what it can do for you and your company. Parts two and three of the book give you a prescribed yet flexible roadmap to follow in selecting, enacting and realizing improvements from Lean Six Sigma projects. Within this step-by-step structure, the authors demonstrate when and how to use the many Lean Six Sigma statistics and 'tools', packing the pages with diagrams, real-life examples, templates, tips and advice. If you are a Green Belt or a Black Belt, or trainee, these two parts will be invaluable to you. <i>The Complete Idiot's Guide to Lean Six Sigma</i> is the first book of its kind to integrate the Lean Six Sigma tools within a clear stepwise progression, so readers know when and how to actually apply them in their jobs. As such, this book is superior as a companion to any corporate or organizational Lean Six Sigma 'deployment'. No more complex hodgepodge. Other books about Lean and/or Six Sigma tend to provide a lot of good information, tools and statistics,  but mostly in a disconnected way, not in a way that is straightforward and user friendly. This makes an already complex subject seem still complex to the neophyte reader. On the other hand, the structure and progression of this book unfolds Lean Six Sigma in a way that a reader can easily become a user, and move more quickly from knowledge to application.Therefore, using Th<i>e Complete Idiot's Guide to Lean Six Sigma</i>, you know why the statistics are important and where to use them, because this is made clear. You know how and when to use a Pareto Chart, or do a Stakeholder Analysis, or conduct a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). You not only get fully primed on all the parts and parcels of Lean Six Sigma, but you truly learn enough to become dangerous - in a good way! In a way that makes you more valuable to your organization. Also for Lean Six Sigma leaders, not just practitioners. Just as a Lean Six Sigma practitioner follows a proven formula for process improvement, a Lean Six Sigma Leader generally follows a process for achieving organizational transformation. This is why the final part of the book focuses on what a Lean Six Sigma leader or Champion needs to know and do to be successful - again according to a detailed step-by-step process that can be followed exactly or modified to fit specific needs. This includes: <br/><br/>? Identifying and selecting Lean Six Sigma projects. <br/><br/>? Understanding the process of organizational transformation. <br/><br/>? Installing an infrastructure for Lean Six Sigma deployment.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Explanations of theory, lists of rules, and discussions of procedure are the basis of learning the lean Six Sigma, however without a visceral understanding of the application of this powerful system in various circumstances the knowledge remains, at best, conjecture. Detailed examination of case studies that take real-world variables into account is the only way to truly master Lean Six Sigma.<br/><br/>Providing a comprehensive Lean Six Sigma case study from start to finish, <strong>Implementing Lean Six Sigma throughout the Supply Chain: The Comprehensive and Transparent Case Study</strong> employs the Define—Measure—Analyze—Improve—Control (DMAIC) process used in today’s retail industry. <br/><br/>Going far beyond the brief overview found in current texts, this interactive case study presents all of the data used by a team as they implement Lean Six Sigma in a distribution center. It details their decision-making rational, thus allowing the reader to extrapolate and implement the same analyses and conclusions in their own settings.<br/><br/>The downloadable resources contain all of the numerous graphs, charts, tables, and data analyses provided in the text. It provides PowerPoint training slides and easily accessible data sets that correspond to the figures in the book, as well as a full Glossary and reference guide to commonly used Lean and Six Sigma terms.<br/><br/>Providing a clear link between all of the Lean Six Sigma tools and their application in a real-world setting, indispensible training tool gives the all-important, rubber-meets-the-road understanding needed to start you on your Lean Six Sigma journey.</p><p></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Reusing well-written, well-debugged, and well-tested code improves productivity, code quality, and software configurability and relieves pressure on software developers. When you organize your code into self-contained modular units, you can use them as building blocks for your future projects and share them with other programmers, if needed. Understand the benefits and downsides of seven code reuse models so you can confidently reuse code at any development stage. Create static and dynamic libraries in C and Python, two of the most popular modern programming languages. Adapt your code for the real world: deploy shared functions remotely and build software that accesses them using remote procedure calls.</p><p>Avoid the drawbacks and harness the benefits associated with seven code reuse models. Create static and dynamic libraries in C and Python, deploy shared functions remotely, and build software that makes intelligent use of remote procedure calls. In no time at all, you'll develop the confidence to reuse code at any stage of real-world development.</p><p>This one-stop solution covers the complete build cycle: editing, compiling, linking, and running a ready program. Apply Linux/macOS power software development tools, such as ld, ldd, ranlib, and nm, to construct and explore state-of-the-art function libraries in C that could be linked with application-specific code either permanently or for the duration of execution. Learn why Python has modules for reuse and how they differ from C object files and libraries. Understand the risks and other negative implications of sharing and reuse. As a bonus, distill the dependencies between your project's components and automate and optimize your build process with the \"make\" utility.</p><p>Whether you are an amateur coder or an experienced developer, become a more productive and resourceful programmer by reusing previously written code.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>To compile and run the C examples mentioned in the book, you need a decent C compiler (GCC is the best, but Intel and Microsoft would probably work, too) and a set of C development tools: maker (make), linker (ld), file, strip, ldd, and ranlib. Again, the GNU development toolset works marvels; other toolsets may or may not work. All examples in the book have been tested on a Linux computer but will most likely work on macOS. For the Python examples, a Python-3.x interpreter is all you want. No third-party modules are required.</p></div></span>",

[It] is likely to become a standard\nfor test training as well as a good reference for professional\ntesters and developers. I would also recommend this book as\nbackground material for negotiating outsourced software contracts.\nI often work as an expert witness in litigation for software with\nvery poor quality, and this book might well reduce or eliminate\nthese lawsuits….”</em><br/>\n–Capers Jones, VP and CTO, Namcook Analytics LLC</p><p>Software and system testers repeatedly fall\nvictim to the same pitfalls. Think of them as\n“anti-patterns”: mistakes that make testing far less\neffective and efficient than it ought to be. In <em><b>Common System\nand Software Testing Pitfalls,</b></em> Donald G. Firesmith catalogs\n92 of these pitfalls. Drawing on his 35 years of software and\nsystem engineering experience, Firesmith shows testers and\ntechnical managers and other stakeholders how to avoid falling into\nthese pitfalls, recognize when they have already fallen in, and\nescape while minimizing their negative consequences.</p><p>Firesmith writes for testing professionals\nand other stakeholders involved in large or medium-sized projects.\nHis anti-patterns and solutions address both “pure\nsoftware” applications and “software-reliant\nsystems,” encompassing heterogeneous subsystems, hardware,\nsoftware, data, facilities, material, and personnel. For each\npitfall, he identifies its applicability, characteristic symptoms,\npotential negative consequences and causes, and offers specific\nactionable recommendations for avoiding it or limiting its\nconsequences.</p><p>This guide will help you</p><li><p>Pinpoint testing processes that need improvement–before,\nduring, and after the project</p></li><li><p>Improve shared understanding and collaboration among all\nproject participants</p></li><li><p>Develop, review, and optimize future project testing\nprograms</p></li><li><p>Make your test documentation far more useful</p></li><li><p>Identify testing risks and appropriate risk-mitigation\nstrategies</p></li><li><p>Categorize testing problems for metrics collection, analysis,\nand reporting</p></li><li><p>Train new testers, QA specialists, and other project\nstakeholders</p></li><p>With 92 common testing pitfalls organized\ninto 14 categories, this taxonomy of testing pitfalls should be\nrelatively complete. However, in spite of its comprehensiveness, it\nis also quite likely that additional pitfalls and even missing\ncategories of pitfalls will be identified over time as testers read\nthis book and compare it to their personal experiences. As an\nenhancement to the print edition, the author has provided the\nfollowing location on the web where readers can find major\nadditions and modifications to this taxonomy of pitfalls: http://donald.firesmith.net/home/common-testing-pitfalls</p><p>Please send any recommended changes and\nadditions to dgf (at) sei (dot) cmu (dot) edu, and the author will\nconsider them for publication both on the website and in future\neditions of this book.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Six Sigma for Powerful Improvement",
			"description": "<span><p>Although the Six Sigma Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control (DMAIC) methodology is a widely accepted tool for achieving efficient management of all aspects of operations, there are still many unwarranted concerns about its perceived complexity and implementation costs. Dispelling these myths, <strong>Six Sigma for Powerful Improvement: A Green Belt DMAIC Training System with Software Tools and a 25-Lesson Course </strong>clarifies the long-accepted statistical and logical processes of Six Sigma and provides you with tools you can use again and again in your own \"real world\" projects—removing any doubts regarding their simplicity and \"doability.\".<br/><br/>Not only does the book provide you with reasons for using the tools, it reveals the underlying doctrines, formulas, and steps required. Although the tools and techniques presented are specifically associated with the DMAIC philosophy, they are applicable across a wide range of management and improvement scenarios. Explaining Six Sigma processes in language that's easy to understand, the book starts with an overview, followed by specific techniques and procedures. It presents detailed, illustrated lesson segments that include an agenda, roadmap, objectives, and a list of takeaway concepts. It also:<br/></p><ul><p></p><li>Provides seven separate Excel tool templates—each with its own user guide and additional smaller tools</li><li>Presents completed Excel sample workbooks for each tool to facilitate your comprehension and utilization confidence</li><li>Includes downloadable resources with a PowerPoint-based DMAIC training course, the aforementioned Excel-based Six Sigma tools and workbooks, and extensive instructor’s notes embedded in each lesson</li></ul><p>Trained as and employed as a Black Belt and later as a Master Black Belt, the author presents doctrines and procedures with a strong pedigree and history of success. The book uses hundreds of figures and tables to illustrate key concepts and also makes them available in full-color on the downloadable resources. This is also true of the figures in the user guides that document the accompanying tools. For each of the tools, the book includes a completed sample workbook. The PowerPoint and Excel lessons and tools are provided in both 2007 and 97-2003 versions.</p></span>",

Higher life expectancies, fewer medical errors, lower costs, and improved transparency are all possible through HIT.<br/><br/>Taking an integrated approach<b>, </b><strong>Impact of Healthcare Informatics on Quality of Patient Care and Health Services </strong>examines the<strong> </strong>various types of organizations, including nonprofit hospitals, for-profit hospitals, community health centers, and government hospitals. By doing so, it provides you with a comparative perspective of how different organizations adapt and use the technology.<br/><br/>The first part of the book covers the basics of HIT. It explains the significant changes that the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) will bring about for stakeholders. This section includes coverage of key organizational cultural factors, management changes that will result from HIT, hospital financing changes that may take effect, a cost-benefit analysis of electronic medical records (EMRs), and the numerous organizational behavior changes stimulated by HIT.<br/><br/>The second part of the book focuses on the broader community: the patient, the physician, government, and how HIT will impact each.<b> </b>These chapters cover quality of care and cost impacts on the patient from HIT, changes for patients of varying socioeconomic statuses, physician perceptions of HIT, medical malpractice lawsuits involving the use of HIT, bioterrorism, and use of EMRs. The book also includes a discussion about mobile health, and how a rapidly growing mobile health generation is changing the face of healthcare as we know it.</p></span>",

Today, most\ndevelopers acknowledge the benefits of unit testing and rely on the\nincreasingly sophisticated tools now available. The recently\nreleased JUnit 4.5 represents the state of the art in unit testing\nframeworks, and provides significant new features to improve the\nJava development process.\n<em>JUnit in Action, Second Edition</em> is an up-to-date guide to\nunit testing Java applications (including Java EE applications)\nusing the JUnit framework and its extensions. This book provides\ntechniques for solving real-world problems such as testing AJAX\napplications, using mocks to achieve testing isolation,\nin-container testing for Java EE and database applications, and\ntest automation.\nWritten to help readers exploit JUnit 4.5, the book covers\nrecent innovations such as the new annotations that simplify test\nwriting, improved exception handling, and the new assertion\nmethods. You'll also discover how to use JUnit extensions to test\nnew application styles and frameworks including Ajax, OSGi, and\nHTML-based presentation layers.\nUsing a sample-driven approach, various unit testing strategies\nare covered, such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications,\nand web applications. Also addressed are testing strategies using\nfreely available open source frameworks and tools, and how to unit\ntest in isolation with Mock Objects. The book will also bring you\nup to speed on the latest thinking in TDD, BDD, Continuous\nIntegration, and other practices related to unit testing.\n</p></span>",

Anyone who feels that TDD is \"Too Damn Difficult\" will appreciate this book.</p><p><em>Design Driven Testing</em> shows that, by combining a forward-thinking development process with cutting-edge automation, testing can be a finely targeted, business-driven, rewarding effort. In other words, you'll learn how to test smarter, not harder.</p><ul><li><p>Applies a feedback-driven approach to each stage of the project lifecycle.</p></li><li><p>Illustrates a lightweight and effective approach using a core subset of UML.</p></li><li><p>Follows a real-life example project using Java and Flex/ActionScript.</p></li><li><p>Presents bonus chapters for advanced DDTers covering unit-test antipatterns (and their opposite, \"test-conscious\" design patterns), and showing how to create your own test transformation templates in Enterprise Architect.</p></li></ul></span></span></span></span>",

Most importantly, it shows how to increase the satisfaction of bank customers and in turn enhance bank competitiveness and market share.</p><b>\n</b><p>Lean for Banks is intended for all levels of bank employees: back-office workers, first-level supervisors, middle- and higher-level managers, and corporate executives. It is also intended for all levels of students at schools that teach banking skills—short courses intended for tellers, college courses in advanced banking operations, and continuing education for bank managers and line employees. This book is an entry-level text on Lean and should give readers enough understanding to prepare them for active participation in Lean deployment activities.</p></span></span>",

It explains how the normal functions of manufacturing can be applied to commoditize the software testing service to achieve consistent quality across all software projects. This up-to-date reference reviews different software testing tools, techniques, and practices and provides succinct guidance on how to estimate costs, allocate resources, and make competitive bids.

			"description": "<span><p>Whether you need a new tool or just inspiration, <i>Seven Web Frameworks in Seven Weeks</i> explores modern options, giving you a taste of each with ideas that will help you create better apps. You'll see frameworks that leverage modern programming languages, employ unique architectures, live client-side instead of server-side, or embrace type systems. You'll see everything from familiar Ruby and JavaScript to the more exotic Erlang, Haskell, and Clojure.<br/><br/>The rapid evolution of web apps demands innovative solutions: this survey of frameworks and their unique perspectives will inspire you and get you thinking in new ways to meet the challenges you face daily.<br/><br/>This book covers seven web frameworks that are influencing modern web applications and changing web development: <b>Sinatra, CanJS, AngularJS, Ring, Webmachine, Yesod, Immutant</b>. Each of these web frameworks brings unique and powerful ideas to bear on building apps. <br/><br/>Embrace the simplicity of Sinatra, which sheds the trappings of large frameworks and gets back to basics with Ruby. Live in the client with CanJS, and create apps with JavaScript in the browser. Be declarative with AngularJS; say what you want, not how to do it, with a mixture of declarative HTML and JavaScript. Turn the web into data with Ring, and use Clojure to make data your puppet. Become a master of advanced HTTP with Webmachine, and focus the power of Erlang. Prove web theorems with Yesod; see how Haskell's advanced type system isn't just for academics. Develop in luxury with Immutant, an enlightened take on the enterprise framework.<br/><br/><i>Seven Web Frameworks</i> will influence your work, no matter which framework you currently use.<br/><br/>Welcome to a wider web.<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b><br/><br/>You'll need Windows, MacOS X or Linux, along with your favorite web browser. Each chapter will cover what you need to download and which language versions are required.</p></span>",

			"title": "Frontiers of Test Validity Theory",
			"description": "<span><p>This book examines test validity in the behavioral, social, and educational sciences by exploring three fundamental problems: measurement, causation and meaning. Psychometric and philosophical perspectives receive attention along with unresolved issues. The authors explore how measurement is conceived from both the classical and modern perspectives. The importance of understanding the underlying concepts as well as the practical challenges of test construction and use receive emphasis throughout. The book summarizes the current state of the test validity theory field. Necessary background on test theory and statistics is presented as a conceptual overview where needed. </p><p>Each chapter begins with an overview of key material reviewed in previous chapters, concludes with a list of suggested readings, and features boxes with examples that connect theory to practice. These examples reflect actual situations that occurred in psychology, education, and other disciplines in the US and around the globe, bringing theory to life. Critical thinking questions related to the boxed material engage and challenge readers. A few examples include: </p><p>What is the difference between intelligence and IQ?</p><p>Can people disagree on issues of value but agree on issues of test validity?</p><p>Is it possible to ask the same question in two different languages?</p><p>The first part of the book contrasts theories of measurement as applied to the validity of behavioral science measures.The next part considers causal theories of measurement in relation to alternatives such as behavior domain sampling, and then unpacks the causal approach in terms of alternative theories of causation.The final section explores the meaning and interpretation of test scores as it applies to test validity. Each set of chapters opens with a review of the key theories and literature and concludes with a review of related open questions in test validity theory.　 </p><p>Researchers, practitioners and policy makers interested in test validity or developing tests appreciate the book's cutting edge review of test validity. The book also serves as a supplement in graduate or advanced undergraduate courses on test validity, psychometrics, testing or measurement taught in psychology, education, sociology, social work, political science, business, criminal justice and other fields. The book does not assume a background in measurement.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Real-world examples and hands-on experience are invaluable resources when learning how to use new methods and tools, whether in training or in a classroom. Yet there are very few books on Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) that provide the practical knowledge required to be up and running quickly. Until now. <strong>Design for Six Sigma in Product and Service Development: Applications and Case Studies</strong> provides step-by-step analysis and practical guidance on how to apply DFSS in product and service development. </p><p/><p>The book discusses the DFSS roadmap and how it is linked to methodologies, including organizational leadership, product development, system integration, critical parameter management, voice of the customer, quality function deployment, and concept generation. The chapter authors provide real-world case studies that demonstrate how the application of DFSS has significantly improved meeting customer requirements. They follow the Identify-Define-Design-Optimize-Validate (IDDOV) structure for new product or service development. Examples of tools covered include Quality Function Deployment, Voice of the Customer, Pugh Concept Selection, Ideal Function, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, Reliability, Measurement Systems Analysis, Regression Analysis, and Capability Studies, among others. </p><p/><p>Clearly outlining the tools and how to integrate them for robust product and service design, the case studies can be used by industry professionals and academics to learn how to apply DFSS. The book gives you hands-on experience in a safe environment, where experienced Black Belts and Master Black Belts act as mentors and prepare you to touch actual data and make decisions when embarking on real-world projects. Even after you’ve mastered the techniques, the breadth and depth of coverage contained in this book will make it a vital part of your toolkit.</p></span>",

Many companies address this issue by assigning a dedicated software testing phase towards the end of their development cycle. However, quality cannot be tested into a buggy application. Early and continuous unit testing has been shown to be crucial for high quality software and low defect rates. Yet current books on testing ignore the developer's point of view and give little guidance on how to bring the overwhelming amount of testing theory into practice. <i>Unit Testing in Java</i> represents a practical introduction to unit testing for software developers. It introduces the basic test-first approach and then discusses a large number of special issues and problem cases. The book instructs developers through each step and motivates them to explore further.<ul><li>Shows how the discovery and avoidance of software errors is a demanding and creative activity in its own right and can build confidence early in a project. </li><li>Demonstrates how automated tests can detect the unwanted effects of small changes in code within the entire system.</li><li>Discusses how testing works with persistency, concurrency, distribution, and web applications.</li><li>Includes a discussion of testing with C++ and Smalltalk.</li></ul>\n</span>",

			"title": "Fit Sigma: A Lean Approach to Building Sustainable Quality Beyond Six Sigma",
			"description": "<span><span><span><p>To some, the near perfection of the Six Sigma management system appears to be an impossible ideal, especially for small and medium enterprises. FIT SIGMA, a flexible and more sustainable approach, was developed through the integration of the 'hard' Six Sigma approach with Lean Enterprise philosophy. It consists of three elements; fitness for purpose, fitness for improvement and integration, and fitness for sustainability.</p><p><em>FIT SIGMA: A Lean Approach to Building Sustainable Quality Beyond Six Sigma</em> shows how this tripartite approach can be used to add value to both large and small organisations through improved use of resources, and through the provision of improved customer satisfaction. It shows that a holistic approach to operational excellence underpinned by a data driven methodology can be applied equally to the manufacturing, service or public sectors.</p><p>As the Six Sigma philosophy has evolved in recent years to take into account new challenges faced by companies, including climate change, green supply chain, emerging markets and a growing service sector, so FIT SIGMA has also adapted itself to these new demands.</p><p><em>FIT SIGMA: A Lean Approach to Building Sustainable Quality Beyond Six Sigma</em> covers key developing areas including:</p><ul><li><p>Sustainability and Environment</p></li><li><p>Non-profit organizations</p></li><li><p>Service Operations</p></li><li><p>Supply Chain Management</p></li><li><p>Project Management</p></li><li><p>Emerging Markets</p></li><li><p>Small and Medium Enterprises</p></li><li><p>Green Thinking</p></li></ul><p>Each chapter contains practical implementation guide, illustrative examples and case studies, and concludes with a summary of key elements for ease of reference and revision. In addition the book includes a comprehensive glossary of common terms and phrases used in managing quality, along with an appendix which illustrates the applications of basic statistics in Six Sigma and Fit Sigma.</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>To better understand and improve your systems, you must measure and map their essential characteristics. Yet, because your systems and their associated processes occur over varying spatial and temporal scales, you will need various types of maps and metrics—depending on the level of detail and understanding required.<br/><br/>During nearly four decades of experience helping clients across various industries understand, measure, and improve the performance of their processes, Jerry L. Harbour discovered a handful of performance maps that will work in most settings. As such, he's gathered these critical few maps into <b>The Performance Mapping and Measurement Handbook. <br/><br/></b>In this handbook, Dr. Harbour explains performance mapping and measurement techniques at widely differing spatial and temporal scales. Using real-world examples and language that is easy to understand, he demonstrates the effective use of:<br/></p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Node-link maps</li><li>Process activity maps</li><li>Process step maps</li><li>Basic task element maps</li><li>Event pathway maps</li><li>Response timeline maps</li><li>Key performance driver maps </li></ul><p>Filled with graphical illustrations, the book can be read sequentially or used as a \"How do I do that?\" reference book. It includes easy-to-follow explanations along with numerous examples of both good and bad implementation. In addition, it includes case studies from a wide range of operational and industrial settings that clearly demonstrate how the mapping and measurement techniques described in the book can be applied to new technologies and processes.</p></span></span>",

Filling this void, this book details a proven recipe for applying Lean, Six Sigma, and the Theory of Constraints in a manner that will maximize return on investment, cash flow, and net profits.<br/><br/><strong>The \"Success or Die\" Ultimatum: Saving Companies with Blended, Long-Term Improvement Formulas</strong> uses a compelling story format to guide readers through a collection of stories that illustrate best practices for finding and fixing common issues found in today’s organizations. It uses in-depth case studies to illustrate a range of scenarios at a call center, pharmaceutical company, automotive parts supplier, and metals distributor and processor.<br/><br/>Readers will learn simple techniques, such as face-to-face discussions to gather data, as well as more complex diagnostic techniques, such as Four-Field Mapping and process mapping. Readers will better understand the complexities in newly formed working relationships, as well as how to:</p><ul><li>Hire and work with consultants</li><li>Interact with management to get things done</li><li>Engage workers on the front line</li><li>Handle those who are actively against improvements</li><li>Build and sustain a culture of improvement</li><p/></ul><p>The book covers simple, yet effective, statistics and explains how Minitab<sup>®</sup> can be used to simplify and speed up data analysis. In addition, it explains one way to use Statistical Process Control (SPC) to anticipate problems from data and what the results mean. The book includes coverage of project planning, strategy, Lean manufacturing, command and control, finance, PDCA, SPC/root cause analysis, OEE, allocating responsibilities and times to fix, Big Picture mapping, and four-point planning.</p></span></span>",

Since the book was first published, Net Promoter has transformed companies, across industries and sectors, constituting a game-changing system and ethos that rivals Six Sigma in its power.<br/><br/>In this thoroughly updated and expanded edition, Reichheld, with Bain colleague Rob Markey, explains how practitioners have built Net Promoter into a full-fledged management system that drives extraordinary financial and competitive results. With his trademark clarity, Reichheld:<br/><br/>  Defines the fundamental concept of Net Promoter, explaining its connection to your company’s growth and sustained success<br/>  Presents the closed-loop feedback process and demonstrates its power to  energize employees and delight customers<br/>  Shares new and compelling stories of companies that have transformed their performance by putting Net Promoter at the center of their business<br/><br/>Practical and insightful, <i>The Ultimate Question 2.0</i> provides a blueprint for long-term growth and success.</div></span>",

Many other organizations employ Lean and Six Sigma methodologies to eliminate waste and reduce process variation only to find they are not moving the big bars that measure success for the organization. <strong>Driving Strategy to Execution Using Lean Six Sigma: A Framework for Creating High Performance Organizations</strong> details a framework for leveraging an organization’s Lean Six Sigma capability in a manner that drives their strategic plans to execution by linking their strategy deployment into the fabric of their day-to-day operations. </p><p>Bolstered by real-world examples of successful strategy execution, leveraging, and Six Sigma, the book provides:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>An organizational framework for understanding the strategic process</li><li>A model to follow in developing and executing short-range (5 years out) strategies</li><li>A model for longer-range visioning, scenario modeling, and strategy execution</li><li>An assessment tool for measuring an organization’s transformation to high performance</li><p/></ul><p>The framework provides a proven methodology that takes a systems approach to creating high performance. It presents the core process of strategy development and SA&amp;D with the governing process of driving the right metrics through a balanced scorecard approach focused on the organization’s value stream. It then combines this with the enabling process of change management and the creation of a culture of problem solving, waste elimination, and internal discipline to standard work.</p><p>Anyone can write a book on the procedures behind \"Strategy\" without understanding the key drivers that give a strategy excitement, commitment, and fire. Here, Gerhard Plenert and Tom Cluley do more than that. First, they examine how to make a strategy meaningful and powerful. Then, they underline the critical piece to strategy development—the execution piece—which takes the glossy strategy brochure off the shelf and makes a usable and executable plan. The book focuses on how to build great strategies and includes examples of what makes them great. It demonstrates how a well-developed strategy generates excitement within an organization, offering you the tools to navigate and design a workable and achievable plan for success for your organization. </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><strong>Winner of The Shingo Research and Professional Publication Award!</strong></p><p> Everyone knows that in order to reach optimum levels of health, you have to exercise—and that you have to keep at it, day after day after day. No big secret here.  </p><p>It’s the same with process improvement, and, specifically, lean processes. Everything there is to know about Lean has been revealed. Countless books, articles, and seminars provide business leaders all the information they need to understand how lean works and how effective it can be when fully implemented. Again, not a secret. Why, then, do companies invariably fail in their pursuit of operational excellence?</p><p>The same reason people fail to trim fat through exercise. They don’t do it. They try to squeeze it into their schedule; they don’t make it part of their schedule. And, inevitably, it becomes less of a priority. In the same vein, too many business leaders see process improvement as a project, something separate from the more “pressing” goals of profits and growth. </p><p>That’s where they go wrong. And that’s where <em>Building the Fit Organization</em> comes in.</p><p>In this practical, hands-on guide Markovitz walks you step by step through the process of making lean as intrinsic to your company as the pursuit of profits. You will learn how to make an <strong>unshakeable commitment</strong> to <strong>increasing the value</strong> provided by doing the <strong>right work</strong> in the <strong>right way</strong> with <strong>continuous monitoring</strong> of processes and <strong>structured coaching</strong> for everyone. </p><p>You don’t need another book about lean. What you need to learn is how to make process improvement your company’s purpose.</p><p>Like a serious athlete, you’re warmed up. You know what lean is and how it can help your organization. Now it’s time to perform. <em>Building the Fit Organization</em> is the next step to creating a company that can compete on the toughest of playing fields.</p></span></span>",

But the promise of the cloud is unrealized. The cloud isn't just about shedding the physical data center - it's about shedding the data center mindset. Cloud infrastructure can be controlled via API calls. This means we can view it as a giant general-purpose compute - and program it. That's where the Fugue operating system and the Ludwig language come in. They automate the creation, operation, enforcement, and termination of infrastructure in the cloud.</p><p>This definitive Fugue guide starts with a simple website and moves on to a more robust application with evolving infrastructure needs as you walk through the steps to harnessing the cloud. With Amazon Web Services, launch infrastructure quickly. Debug in design time. Automate deployment and enforcement of your cloud. Centralize your change control process and automate continuous auditing. Rest easy knowing configuration drift, unwanted changes, and infrastructure quality issues are addressed, continuously and automatically.

			"description": "<span><div><strong>New tools for managing complexity</strong><br/><br/>Does your organization manage complexity by making things <em>more</em> complicated? If so, you are not alone. <br/><br/>According to The Boston Consulting Group’s fascinating Complexity Index, business complexity has increased sixfold during the past sixty years. And, all the while, organizational complicatedness—that is, the number of structures, processes, committees, decision-making forums, and systems—has increased by a whopping factor of thirty-five. In their attempt to respond to the increasingly complex performance requirements they face, company leaders have created an organizational labyrinth that makes it more and more difficult to improve productivity and to pursue innovation. It also disengages and demotivates the workforce.<br/><br/>Clearly it’s time for leaders to stop trying to manage complexity with their traditional tools and instead better leverage employees' intelligence. This book shows you how and explains the implications for designing and leading organizations. <br/><br/>The way to manage complexity, the authors argue, is neither with the hard solutions of another era nor with the soft solutions—such as team building and feel-good “people initiatives”—that often follow in their wake. Based on social sciences (notably economics, game theory, and organizational sociology) and The Boston Consulting Group’s work with more than five hundred companies in more than forty countries and in various industries, authors Yves Morieux and Peter Tollman recommend six simple rules to manage complexity without getting complicated.<br/><br/>Showing why the rules work and how to put them into practice, Morieux and Tollman give managers a much-needed tool to reinvigorate people in the face of seemingly endless complexity. Included are detailed examples from companies that have achieved a multiplicative effect on performance by using them.<br/><br/>It’s time to manage complexity better. Employ these six simple rules to foster autonomy and cooperation and to effectively handle business complexity. As a result, you will improve productivity, innovate more, reengage your workforce, and seize opportunities to create competitive advantage.<br/></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Its scale, flexibility, cost effectiveness, and fast turnaround are just a few reasons why crowdsourced testing has received so much attention lately. While there are a few online resources that explain what crowdsourced testing is all about, there's been a need for a book that covers best practices, case studies, and the future of this technique. Filling this need, Leveraging the Wisdom of the Crowd in Software Testing shows you how to leverage the wisdom of the crowd in your software testing process. Its comprehensive coverage includes the history of crowdsourcing and crowdsourced testing, implementation practices, and future trends. The book discusses best practices in implementation-explaining what, when, and how to crowdsource in a testing effort. It also includes case studies that illustrate how both product and service companies have successfully applied crowdsourcing in their testing programs. Explaining how to use the combined advantages of crowdsourcing and cloud computing for software testing, the book examines various engagement models in which you could implement crowdsourced testing. It addresses effective defect management in crowdsourced testing and considers both the business and engineering aspects of crowdsourced testing. The book explores the challenges, limitations, and situations when crowdsourced testing will not work and provides powerful best practices for mitigating the constraints and challenges, including how to build a crowdsourcing platform to test software products. Covering career opportunities for crowd testers, the book concludes by taking a look at the need to build a crowdsourced testing ecosystem, who the players of such an ecosystem would be, and who would need to champion such an effort.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Successful development and commercialization of new products are\ncritical to the long term viability of any business. The primary\ngoal of product development is to enable a company to meet its\ngoals for profitability and growth by introducing new, improved and\ninnovative products to the market. The failure of a company to\ncommercialize valuable new product ideas results in the\ncommoditization of that company's product portfolio and potential\nfailure of the business itself.</p><p>In this short cut we examine the business reasons that lead a\ncompany to adopt and implement the Design for Six Sigma\nmethodology. During our discussion we examine the product life\ncycle that all products undergo, beginning with product development\nand ending with product decline. The impact of new, disruptive\ntechnologies on current products is also examined and illustrated\nwith a case study example involving the replacement of vacuum tube\ntechnology by the transistor.</p><p>In addition, an examination of the economics of new product\nintroduction is presented, describing the impact of low priced\nsubstitute and \"surpriser and delighter\" products on existing\nmarkets. Using traditional supply/demand economic analysis in\ncombination with the Kano model, the authors explain the dynamic\nforces which move existing products from premium pricing to a state\nof commoditization. Finally, the authors take a detailed look at\nthe financial metrics used to measure success in a DFSS project.\nDuring this portion of the chapter the authors discuss financial\nmetrics such as Net Present Value; key reasons for failed\ncommercialization programs; and the use of financial sensitivity\nanalysis, including Monte Carlo simulation techniques.</p><p>This short cut describes in detail how DFSS brings value to\ncompanies. Using the language of business, the authors outline how\nDesign for Six Sigma helps companies identify the needs of\ncustomers and emerging product trends through the use of a well\ndefined, structured process. The authors also provides the reader\nwith an understanding of how DFSS can be used to counter the forces\nof product commoditization and the entry of potentially disruptive\ntechnologies in the markets served by the business today.</p><p><b>Contents</b></p><p>What This Short Cut Covers 3</p><p>Introduction 4</p><p>The Product Life Cycle 4</p><p>Where Have All the Vacuum Tubes Gone? 5</p><p>Understanding Dynamic Markets: The Kano Model 8</p><p>The Role of DFSS 12</p><p>Six Sigma Financial Metrics 14</p><p>Candy Wrapper Film: A DFSS Case Study 15</p><p>How to Measure Success in a DFSS Project 16</p><p>What's in the Book <em>Commercializing Great Products with Design\nfor Six Sigma</em>? 36</p><p>About the Authors 45</p><p>Related Publications 46</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Although world-class firms like GE and Motorola have relied on Six Sigma to build their performance cultures, these processes are all too often left out of human resources (HR) functions. This lack of Six Sigma principles is even more surprising because preventing errors and improving productivity are so critical to the people management processes of hiring, retention, appraisal, and development.<br/><br/>From the history and evolution of the Total Quality movement to initiatives for introducing a Six Sigma continuous process improvement strategy in your HR department, <strong>Achieving HR Excellence through Six Sigma</strong> introduces a new way to envision your role within the organization. It explains how this powerful methodology works and supplies a roadmap to help you find and eliminate waste in your HR processes.<br/><br/>Describing exactly what HR excellence means, the book outlines dozens of proven approaches as well as a hierarchy of the exact steps required to achieve it. It illustrates the Six Sigma methodology from the creation of a project to its successful completion. At each stage, it describes the specific tools currently available and provides examples of organizations that have used Six Sigma within HR to improve their organizations.<br/><br/>The text presents proven approaches that can help you solve and even eliminate people management problems altogether. Filled with real-world examples, it demonstrates how to implement six sigma into the transformational side of your organization. It also includes a listing of additional resources to help you along your Six Sigma journey.<br/><br/>Explaining how to build a new business model for your HR organization, the book supplies the new perspective and broad view you will need to discover and recommend game-changing alternatives to traditional HR approaches in your organization.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Of the 100 companies named to Fortune magazine’s list of the world’s largest companies in 1956, only 29 of those companies remain on that list. Many lost their way because they failed to recognize the changes taking place, or were too big to react quickly enough to shifting market conditions. </p><p/><p>Supplying Lean practitioners with a formal process for keeping up with technological advancements and shifting business requirements, <strong>The Future of Lean Sigma Thinking in a Changing Business Environment </strong>provides the tools to survive and prosper through the current business environment. It introduces cutting-edge business solutions from the fields of chemical engineering, aircraft production, and business psychology, and explains how to integrate these concepts with proven Lean principles. </p><p/><p>The book begins by providing a foundation in essential Lean concepts, including Deming and Juran, Six Sigma, Total Quality Management, the Toyota Production System, and New Six Sigma. Next, it reports on the latest advances in process understanding. By analyzing changing attitudes within the system, it illustrates how new products are being developed using updated Lean thinking. In addition, it provides examples that demonstrate the impact of e-commerce on Lean production systems. </p><p/><p>Incorporating the green agenda to Lean thinking, the text supplies the insight to safely navigate your company through a shifting business landscape while reducing your impact on raw materials and the environment. By following the principles discussed in this book, you will not only increase your company’s chances of achieving long-term survival but will position your organization to capitalize on the economic upturn on the horizon.</p><p/></span></span>",

How can you prevent your own\ncareer “train wreck” by learning from their\nexperiences? This book distills the core causes of executive\nfailure, demonstrates how to identify them in your own behavior\n– and helps you to eliminate or avoid them. Bill Lane, Jack\nWelch’s long-time colleague draws on his own experience as a\nGE insider as well as from extensive interviews with former GE\nexecutives now running their own companies, including Dave Calhoun\n(CEO, Nielsen); Jim McNerney (CEO, Boeing); Lloyd Trotter (retired\nVice-Chairman of GE), Frank Doyle (ex-Executive VP at GE), Kip\nCondron (ex-CEO, Americas, AXA Equitable); Andrew McMahon\n(President, AXA Equitable), and many others. Together with these\nelite executives, Lane demonstrates how to avoid arrogance,\nrecognize when you <em>must</em> micromanage, learn how to\ncommunicate far more effectively, maintain a relentless focus on\nwhat matters most, and avoid the temptations to sacrifice your #1\nleadership asset: your integrity. Along the way, he offers\nhard-hitting insights on everything from choosing your battles to\ncultivating the “right” forms of paranoia. <em>Losing\nIt</em> will be an indispensable resource for everyone aspiring to\nbecome a more effective leader, including managers at all levels,\nand all MBA candidates and executive education students.</p></span></span></span>",

			"title": "Out of the Present Crisis",
			"description": "<span><p>Today, organizations have achieved an overall failure rate above 80 percent with Lean, Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, and continuous improvement in general. This is certainly not due to a shortage of books, consultants, and other online resources about the methodologies and tools, or the success stories of Toyota and others. However, it <i>is</i> due to a shortage of knowledge and practice about the most critical success factors of improvement: leadership, sustaining infrastructure, behavioral and cultural transformation, and now emerging technology. These factors produce 90 percent of the success with continuous and sustainable improvement; the methodologies and tools represent an irrelevant 10 percent. For decades, most organizations have focused on this quick and easy, irrelevant 10 percent through an endless series of fad, in-vogue improvement programs as they attempt to mimic the best-in-class practices of the most successful organizations.<br/><br/><strong>Out of the Present Crisis: Rediscovering Improvement in the New Economy</strong> is the contemporary version of Deming’s famous 1982 book, \"Out of the Crisis.\" The author builds a solid case for organizations to aggressively pursue the next generation of systematic and sustainable improvement through a combined strategy of Deming’s back-to-basics, innovation and breakthrough thinking, integration of emerging and enabling technology, and adaptive improvement across diverse environments and industries. The book’s practical, pragmatic style is backed up by many real world examples and personal experiences.<br/><br/>If you're looking for another book about Lean or Six Sigma \"tools\" this is not it. But it is a book about how to achieve lasting success by making improvement the cultural standard of excellence and living code of conduct in organizations. This popular book provides executives with an up-to-date and proven reference guide for rediscovering successful systematic and sustainable improvement in today’s economy. The author demonstrates the importance of viewing improvement as a continuous manageable \"<em>process</em>\" and covers the most critical success factors of leadership, sustaining infrastructure, behavioral and cultural transformation, and emerging technology in a practical, no-nonsense, \"how-to-do\" style. The book provides specific guidance for all industries including public and private corporations, hospitals, financial services, airlines, municipalities, and federal, state, and local governments.<br/><br/></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><br/>Over the last decade Lean and Six Sigma methods and tools have helped organizations improve to historic productivity levels with the data driven, systematic elimination of waste and improvement of flow. Today many organizations have enjoyed the benefits of Lean and Six sigma initiatives, and are looking more to sustain the gains, and aggressively drive a systematic and on-going approach to improvement and problem solving. The concept of diminishing returns applies here, when in the early stages, organizations were able to find \"low-hanging fruit\" and to quickly make significant improvements. Now the easy work is done, and organizations need a simple yet systematic approach to continuing their continuous improvement efforts. <br/>Operations and supply chain leaders will benefit from this book by developing a clear understanding of why and how metric scorecards and dashboards can be used as a powerful data driven improvement tool. This book illustrates visual management, scorecards, and dashboards for a full range of organizations, and focuses on Operations and Supply Chain Management areas. By covering these tools in these environments in a story book format, organization leaders can begin to understand how these methods and tools can be applied in their organizations.<br/></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Every business aspires to be competitive and profitable in its market. To do this, an organization needs to offer customers value propositions, which may be manifest in the product it produces or the service it provides. This in turn will create customer loyalty and growth. There are a number of organizational philosophies and strategies used by businesses to help accomplish this goal, among which are the concepts of Six Sigma and Lean. This book proposes to integrate the best practices from each of these philosophies and apply them to a customer-focused organization—a cruise ship—whose overriding mission is to deliver superior service to its customers. The authors demonstrate in this book how key components of both Six Sigma and Lean—such as identifying and removing defects, elimination of waste, metrics, speed of delivery, and the seamless integration of these concepts and practices throughout the operation—serve to enhance the kind of value propositions that customers recognize and that allow an organization to be successful.</p></span>",

The process of analyzing component\nvariation and designing a final product that meets customer\ntolerance requirements is known as statistical tolerancing.</p><p>In this Short Cut, various Design for Six\nSigma techniques for determining the impact of multiple sources of\nvariation on a final product are examined in detail. A procedure is\ndescribed for using representative models for individual product\ncomponents to estimate the expected overall level of variation in\nthe performance of a final product.</p><p>Three methods of tolerance analysis are\npresented and the merits of each are discussed: Worst Case\nAnalysis, Root Sum of Squares Analysis, and Six Sigma Tolerance\nAnalysis. A detailed case study example, involving multiple sources\nof variation, is employed to illustrate the application of these\nmethods. Minitab® is used to identify the best-fitting\ndistributions from data sets for individual components. Monte Carlo\nSimulation with Crystal Ball® is then employed to determine\nthe most important individual sources of variation and the overall\nvariation of the final product. Finally, Crystal Ball's\nOptQuest® optimization feature is utilized to determine the\nrequired design value for each key parameter to meet final customer\nrequirements.</p><p><b>Contents</b></p><p>What This Short Cut Covers</p><p>Introduction</p><p>Worst Case Analysis</p><p>Root Sum of Squares Analysis</p><p>Six Sigma Tolerance Analysis</p><p>What's in the Book <em>Commercializing Great\nProducts with Design for Six Sigma</em></p><p>About the Authors</p><p>Related Publications</p></span></span></span>",

Recounting numerous Lean Six Sigma transformations, it illustrates the spectrum of successful operational tactics.<br/><br/>The story starts just outside Detroit, Michigan in the 1970s when the auto industry was booming, and most people in the area worked in the car factories, or in one of the component factories that supplied the Big Three. The complexity and detail of the projects grow chapter by chapter. The book begins by explaining how to manage Lean basics such as applying 5S, shortening product cycle times, and creating standard work. It then progresses to factory Lean Six Sigma transformations. Providing implementation guidance geared to functions on the operational level, the book:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Presents stories based on the author’s interactions with company leaders and shop-floor employees in the midst of great change</li><li>Illustrates real-world plant politics and manufacturing situations using compelling stories</li><li>Highlights valuable lessons learned at the end of each chapter</li></ul><p>Using an engaging story format, the book recounts the author’s career experiences to provide you with a real-world understanding of how to use Lean tools. The stories in the book illustrate everything from standard work and takt time to Kaizen events and Total Productive Maintenance. The text also includes accounts of \"front end\" or administrative processes such as product development and materials handling.</p></span></span>",
