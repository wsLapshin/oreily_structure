			"description": "<span><div><p>Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with <em><strong>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</strong></em>. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.</p><p>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.</p><p><em><strong>Clean Code</strong></em> is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.</p><p>Readers will come away from this book understanding</p><ul><li><p>How to tell the difference between good and bad code</p></li><li><p>How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code</p></li><li><p>How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes</p></li><li><p>How to format code for maximum readability</p></li><li><p>How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic</p></li><li><p>How to unit test and practice test-driven development</p></li></ul><p>This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.</p></div></span>",

Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves.</p><p>The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.</p><p>Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.</p></div></span>",

Great software isn’t written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. <strong><em>The Clean Coder</em></strong> will help you become one of them–and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.</p></div></span>",

Design patterns are commonly accepted solutions to well-recognized design problems. In essence, they are a library of reusable components, only for software architecture, and not for a concrete implementation.\n</p><p>The focus of this book is on the design patterns that naturally lend themselves to the needs of a C++ programmer, and on the patterns that uniquely benefit from the features of C++, in particular, the generic programming. Armed with the knowledge of these patterns, you will spend less time searching for a solution to a common problem and be familiar with the solutions developed from experience, as well as their advantages and drawbacks. The other use of design patterns is as a concise and an efficient way to communicate. A pattern is a familiar and instantly recognizable solution to specific problem; through its use, sometimes with a single line of code, we can convey a considerable amount of information. The code conveys: \"This is the problem we are facing, these are additional considerations that are most important in our case; hence, the following well-known solution was chosen.\"\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of design patterns to create robust, reusable, and maintainable code.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Recognize the most common design patterns used in C++\n</li><li>Understand how to use C++ generic programming to solve common design problems\n</li><li>Explore the most powerful C++ idioms, their strengths, and drawbacks\n</li><li>Rediscover how to use popular C++ idioms with generic programming\n</li><li>Understand the impact of design patterns on the program's performance\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for experienced C++ developers and programmers who wish to learn about software design patterns and principles and apply them to create robust, reusable, and easily maintainable apps.</p></span>",

It's for you, the embedded C programmer.  TDD helps you prevent defects and build software with a long useful life.  This is the first book to teach the hows and whys of TDD for C programmers.<br/><br/>TDD is a modern programming practice C developers need to know. It's a different way to program---unit tests are written in a tight feedback loop with the production code,  assuring your code does what you think.  You get valuable feedback every few minutes. You find  mistakes before they become bugs. You get early warning of design problems. You get immediate notification of side effect defects.  You get to spend more time adding valuable features to your product.<br/><br/>James is one of the few experts in applying TDD to embedded C. With his 1.5 decades of training,coaching, and practicing TDD in C, C++, Java, and C# he will lead you from being a novice in TDD to using the techniques that few have mastered.<br/><br/>This book is full of code written for embedded C programmers.  You don't just see the end product, you see code and tests evolve. James leads you through the thought process and decisions made each step of the way.   You'll learn techniques for test-driving code right nextto the hardware, and you'll learn design principles and how to apply them to C to keep your code clean and flexible.<br/><br/>To run the examples in this book, you will need a C/C++ development environment on your machine, and the GNU GCC tool chain or Microsoft Visual Studio for C++ (some project conversion may be needed).</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p><strong>An Expert Guide to Software Performance Optimization</strong></p><p>From mobile and cloud apps to video games to driverless vehicle control, more and more software is time-constrained: It must deliver reliable results seamlessly, consistently, and virtually instantaneously. If it doesn't, customers are unhappy--and sometimes lives are put at risk. When complex software underperforms or fails, software engineers need to identify and address the root causes. This is difficult and, historically, few tools have been available to help.</p><p>In <em><strong>Understanding Software Dynamics</strong></em>, performance expert Richard L. Sites tackles the problem head on, offering expert methods and advanced tools for understanding complex, time-constrained software dynamics, improving reliability and troubleshooting challenging performance problems.</p><p>Sites draws on several decades of experience pioneering software performance optimization, as well as extensive experience teaching graduate-level developers. He introduces principles and techniques for use in any environment, from embedded devices to datacenters, illuminating them with examples based on x86 or ARM processors running Linux and linked by Ethernet. He also guides readers through building and applying a powerful, new, extremely low-overhead open-source software tool, KUtrace, to precisely trace executions on every CPU core. Using insights gleaned from this tool, readers can apply nuanced solutions--not merely brute-force techniques such as turning off caches or cores.</p><ul><li><p>Measure and address issues associated with CPUs, memory, disk/SSD, networks, and their interactions</p></li><li><p>Fix programs that are always too slow, and those that sometimes lag for no apparent reason</p></li><li><p>Design useful observability, logging, and time-stamping capabilities into your code</p></li><li><p>Reason more effectively about performance data to see why reality differs from expectations</p></li><li><p>Identify problems such as excess execution, slow instruction execution, waiting for resources, and software locks</p></li></ul><p><em><strong>Understanding Software Dynamics</strong></em> will be valuable to experienced software professionals, including application and OS developers, hardware and system architects, real-time system designers, and game developers, as well as advanced students.</p><p><em>Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

			"description": "<span><span><p>In 1994, <em>Design Patterns</em> changed the landscape of\nobject-oriented development by introducing classic solutions to\nrecurring design problems. In 1999, <em>Refactoring</em>\nrevolutionized design by introducing an effective process for\nimproving code. With the highly anticipated <em><b>Refactoring to\nPatterns</b></em>, Joshua Kerievsky has changed our approach to\ndesign by forever uniting patterns with the evolutionary process of\nrefactoring.</p><p>This book introduces the theory and practice of pattern-directed\nrefactorings: sequences of low-level refactorings that allow\ndesigners to safely move designs to, towards, or away from pattern\nimplementations. Using code from real-world projects, Kerievsky\ndocuments the thinking and steps underlying over two dozen\npattern-based design transformations. Along the way he offers\ninsights into pattern differences and how to implement patterns in\nthe simplest possible ways.</p><p>Coverage includes:</p><li><p>A catalog of twenty-seven pattern-directed refactorings,\nfeaturing real-world code examples</p></li><li><p>Descriptions of twelve design smells that indicate the need for\nthis book’s refactorings</p></li><li><p>General information and new insights about patterns and\nrefactoring</p></li><li><p>Detailed implementation mechanics: how low-level refactorings\nare combined to implement high-level patterns</p></li><li><p>Multiple ways to implement the same pattern—and when to\nuse each</p></li><li><p>Practical ways to get started even if you have little\nexperience with patterns or refactoring</p></li><p><b><em>Refactoring to Patterns</em></b> reflects three years of\nrefinement and the insights of more than sixty software engineering\nthought leaders in the global patterns, refactoring, and agile\ndevelopment communities.

In software engineering, a design pattern is an elected solution for solving software design problems. Although they have been around for a while, design patterns remain one of the top topics in software engineering, and are a ready source for software developers to solve the problems they face on a regular basis. This book takes you through a variety of design patterns and explains them with real-world examples. You will get to grips with low-level details and concepts that show you how to write Python code, without focusing on common solutions as enabled in Java and C++. You'll also fnd sections on corrections, best practices, system architecture, and its designing aspects. This book will help you learn the core concepts of design patterns and the way they can be used to resolve software design problems. You'll focus on most of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, which are used to solve everyday problems, and take your skills to the next level with reactive and functional patterns that help you build resilient, scalable, and robust applications.

			"description": "<span><p>Jack the Ripper and legacy codebases have more in common than you'd think. Inspired by forensic psychology methods, you'll learn strategies to predict the future of your codebase, assess refactoring direction, and understand how your team influences the design. With its unique blend of forensic psychology and code analysis, this book arms you with the strategies you need, no matter what programming language you use.<br/><br/>Software is a living entity that's constantly changing. To understand software systems, we need to know where they came from and how they evolved. By mining commit data and analyzing the history of your code, you can start fixes ahead of time to eliminate broken designs, maintenance issues, and team productivity bottlenecks. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn forensic psychology techniques to successfully maintain your software. You'll create a geographic profile from your commit data to find hotspots, and apply temporal coupling concepts to uncover hidden relationships between unrelated areas in your code. You'll also measure the effectiveness of your code improvements. You'll learn how to apply these techniques on projects both large and small. For small projects, you'll get new insights into your design and how well the code fits your ideas. For large projects, you'll identify the good and the fragile parts.<br/><br/>Large-scale development is also a social activity, and the team's dynamics influence code quality. That's why this book shows you how to uncover social biases when analyzing the evolution of your system. You'll use commit messages as eyewitness accounts to what is really happening in your code. Finally, you'll put it all together by tracking organizational problems in the code and finding out how to fix them. Come join the hunt for better code!<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b><br/><br/>You need Java 6 and Python 2.7 to run the accompanying analysis tools. You also need Git to follow along with the examples.</p></span>",

Software developers, architects, and technical management teams rely on high-level software design patterns such as microservices architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD) to make their work easier.</p><p>This book covers these proven architecture design patterns with a forward-looking approach to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites.</p><p>Starting with the initial stages of design, you will learn about the main blocks and mental flow to use at the start of a project. The book covers various architectural patterns like microservices, web services, and event-driven structures and how to choose the one best suited to your project. Establishing a foundation of required concepts, you will progress into development, debugging, and testing to produce high-quality code that is ready for deployment. You will learn about ongoing operations on how to continue the task after the system is deployed to end users, as the software development lifecycle is never finished.</p><p>By the end of this Python book, you will have developed \"architectural thinking\": a different way of approaching software design, including making changes to ongoing systems.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Think like an architect, analyzing software architecture patterns</li><li>Explore API design, data storage, and data representation methods</li><li>Investigate the nuances of common architectural structures</li><li>Utilize and interoperate elements of patterns such as microservices</li><li>Implement test-driven development to perform quality code testing</li><li>Recognize chunks of code that can be restructured as packages</li><li>Maintain backward compatibility and deploy iterative changes</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book will help software developers and architects understand the structure of large complex systems and adopt architectural patterns that are scalable. Examples in the book are implemented in Python so a fair grasp of basic Python concepts is expected. Proficiency in any programming languages such as Java or JavaScript is sufficient.</p></span>",

Now,\ntwo of the world's most respected C++ experts distill the rich\ncollective experience of the global C++ community into a set of\ncoding standards that every developer and development team can\nunderstand and use as a basis for their own coding standards.</p><p>The authors cover virtually every facet of C++ programming:\ndesign and coding style, functions, operators, class design,\ninheritance, construction/destruction, copying, assignment,\nnamespaces, modules, templates, genericity, exceptions, STL\ncontainers and algorithms, and more. Each standard is described\nconcisely, with practical examples. From type definition to error\nhandling, this book presents C++ best practices, including some\nthat have only recently been identified and standardized-techniques\nyou may not know even if you've used C++ for years. Along the way,\nyou'll find answers to questions like</p><li><p>What's worth standardizing--and what isn't?</p></li><li><p>What are the best ways to code for scalability?</p></li><li><p>What are the elements of a rational error handling policy?</p></li><li><p>How (and why) do you avoid unnecessary initialization, cyclic,\nand definitional dependencies?</p></li><li><p>When (and how) should you use static and dynamic polymorphism\ntogether?</p></li><li><p>How do you practice \"safe\" overriding?</p></li><li><p>When should you provide a no-fail swap?</p></li><li><p>Why and how should you prevent exceptions from propagating\nacross module boundaries?</p></li><li><p>Why shouldn't you write namespace declarations or directives in\na header file?</p></li><li><p>Why should you use STL vector and string instead of\narrays?</p></li><li><p>How do you choose the right STL search or sort algorithm?</p></li><li><p>What rules should you follow to ensure type-safe code?</p></li><p>Whether you're working alone or with others, <em><b>C++ Coding\nStandards</b></em> will help you write cleaner code--and write it\nfaster, with fewer hassles and less frustration.</p><p><br/><br/></p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Are you working on a codebase where cost overruns, death marches, and heroic fights with legacy code monsters are the norm? Battle these adversaries with novel ways to identify and prioritize technical debt, based on behavioral data from how developers work with code. And that's just for starters. Because good code involves social design, as well as technical design, you can find surprising dependencies between people and code to resolve coordination bottlenecks among teams. Best of all, the techniques build on behavioral data that you already have: your version-control system. Join the fight for better code!</p><p>Use statistics and data science to uncover both problematic code and the behavioral patterns of the developers who build your software. This combination gives you insights you can't get from the code alone. Use these insights to prioritize refactoring needs, measure their effect, find implicit dependencies between different modules, and automatically create knowledge maps of your system based on actual code contributions.</p><p>In a radical, much-needed change from common practice, guide organizational decisions with objective data by measuring how well your development teams align with the software architecture. Discover a comprehensive set of practical analysis techniques based on version-control data, where each point is illustrated with a case study from a real-world codebase. Because the techniques are language neutral, you can apply them to your own code no matter what programming language you use. Guide organizational decisions with objective data by measuring how well your development teams align with the software architecture. Apply research findings from social psychology to software development, ensuring you get the tools you need to coach your organization towards better code.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>If you're an experienced programmer, software architect, or technical manager, you'll get a new perspective that will change how you work with code.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p>You don't have to install anything to follow along in the book.

Many patterns are accompanied by\nUML diagrams.</p><p>Building on their best-selling First\nEdition, Shalloway and Trott have thoroughly updated this book to\nreflect new software design trends, patterns, and implementation\ntechniques. Reflecting extensive reader feedback, they have\ndeepened and clarified coverage throughout, and reorganized content\nfor even greater ease of understanding. New and revamped coverage\nin this edition includes</p><li><p>Better ways to start \"thinking in patterns\"</p></li><li><p>How design patterns can facilitate agile development using\neXtreme Programming and other methods</p></li><li><p>How to use commonality and variability analysis to design\napplication architectures</p></li><li><p>The key role of testing into a patterns-driven development\nprocess</p></li><li><p>How to use factories to instantiate and manage objects more\neffectively</p></li><li><p>The Object-Pool Pattern–a new pattern not identified by\nthe \"Gang of Four\"</p></li><li><p>New study/practice questions at the end of every chapter</p></li><p>Gentle yet thorough, this book assumes no\npatterns experience whatsoever. It's the ideal \"first book\" on\npatterns, and a perfect complement to Gamma's classic <em>Design\nPatterns</em>. If you're a programmer or architect who wants the\nclearest possible understanding of design patterns–or if\nyou've struggled to make them work for you–read this\nbook.</p></span>",

Russ\nOlsen has done a great job of selecting classic patterns and\naugmenting these with newer patterns that have special relevance\nfor Ruby. He clearly explains each idea, making a wealth of\nexperience available to Ruby developers for their own daily\nwork.\"</p><p>—Steve Metsker, Managing Consultant with Dominion Digital,\nInc.</p><p>\"This book provides a great demonstration of the key 'Gang of\nFour' design patterns without resorting to overly technical\nexplanations. Written in a precise, yet almost informal style, this\nbook covers enough ground that even those without prior exposure to\ndesign patterns will soon feel confident applying them using Ruby.\nOlsen has done a great job to make a book about a classically 'dry'\nsubject into such an engaging and even occasionally humorous\nread.\"</p><p>—Peter Cooper</p><p>\"This book renewed my interest in understanding patterns after a\ndecade of good intentions. Russ picked the most useful patterns for\nRuby and introduced them in a straightforward and logical manner,\ngoing beyond the GoF's patterns. This book has improved my use of\nRuby, and encouraged me to blow off the dust covering the GoF\nbook.\"</p><p>—Mike Stok</p><p>\"<em><b>Design Patterns in Ruby</b></em> is a great way for\nprogrammers from statically typed objectoriented languages to learn\nhow design patterns appear in a more dynamic, flexible language\nlike Ruby.\"</p><p>—Rob Sanheim, Ruby Ninja, Relevance</p><p>Most design pattern books are based on C++ and Java. But Ruby is\ndifferent—and the language's unique qualities make design\npatterns easier to implement and use. In this book, Russ Olsen\ndemonstrates how to combine Ruby's power and elegance with\npatterns, and write more sophisticated, effective software with far\nfewer lines of code.</p><p>After reviewing the history, concepts, and goals of design\npatterns, Olsen offers a quick tour of the Ruby\nlanguage—enough to allow any experienced software developer\nto immediately utilize patterns with Ruby. The book especially\ncalls attention to Ruby features that simplify the use of patterns,\nincluding dynamic typing, code closures, and \"mixins\" for easier\ncode reuse.</p><p>Fourteen of the classic \"Gang of Four\" patterns are considered\nfrom the Ruby point of view, explaining what problems each pattern\nsolves, discussing whether traditional implementations make sense\nin the Ruby environment, and introducing Ruby-specific\nimprovements. You'll discover opportunities to implement patterns\nin just one or two lines of code, instead of the endlessly repeated\nboilerplate that conventional languages often require.</p><p><b><em>Design Patterns in Ruby</em></b> also identifies innovative\nnew patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community. These\ninclude ways to create custom objects with metaprogramming, as well\nas the ambitious Rails-based \"Convention Over Configuration\"\npattern, designed to help integrate entire applications and\nframeworks.</p><p>Engaging, practical, and accessible, <em><b>Design Patterns in\nRuby</b></em> will help you build better software while making your\nRuby programming experience more rewarding.</p></span>",

Apex being a proprietor programming language from Salesforce to be worked with multi tenant environment is a lot different than traditional OOPs languages like Java and C#. It acts as a workflow engine for managing collaboration of the data between users, a user interface model to handle forms and other interactions, and a SOAP API for programmatic access and integration.</p><p>Apex Design Patterns gives you an insight to several problematic situations that can arise while developing on Force.com platform and the usage of Design patterns to solve them. Packed with real life examples, it gives you a walkthrough from learning design patterns that Apex can offer us, to implementing the appropriate ones in your own application. Furthermore, we learn about the creational patterns that deal with object creation mechanism and structural patterns that helps to identify the relationship between entities. Also, the behavioural and concurrency patterns are put forward explaining the communication between objects and multi-threaded programming paradigm respectively. We later on, deal with the issues regarding structuring of classes, instantiating or how to give a dynamic behaviour at a runtime, with the help of anti-patterns. We learn the basic OOPs principal in polymorphic and modular way to enhance its capability. Also, best practices of writing Apex code are explained to differentiate between the implementation of appropriate patterns. This book will also explain some unique patterns that could be applied to get around governor limits.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will be a maestro in developing your applications on Force.com for Salesforce</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book is a step-by-step guide, complete with well-tested programs and real world situations to solve your common occurring problems in Apex design by using the anti-patterns.

Sure, it's fun to spend hours on your phone looking at what other people have created; but that's nothing compared to the joy and satisfaction of creating things that other people consume and use. Yep, coding is fun!</p><p>And if that weren't enough, when you learn to code you develop all sorts of invaluable skills and traits beyond just coding. These include planning, problem solving, communication, logic, empathy, attention to detail, patience, resilience, persistence, and creativity. And it turns out that these skills (especially creativity and creative problem solving) are some of the most in-demand out there. So, coding will help your future career, too, regardless of what that career may be.</p><p>But, where to start?</p><p>Captain Code is a welcoming, engaging, and fun introduction to becoming a coder, designed for the young (ages 10-17) and young-at-heart. Experienced educators and coders Ben &amp; Shmuel Forta will guide you using Python, one of the most popular programming languages in the world. You'll learn by creating games, yes, games, from simple projects to retro text-based adventures to complete graphical arcade style games. Captain Code is 400 glossy color pages of goodness packed with welcoming images, useful tips and tidbits, and engaging, readable text that focuses on doing while having fun. All code listings are in full-color and QR codes link to bonus content, downloads, challenge solutions, and more.</p><p>Captain Code makes coding exciting and rewarding, as it prepares a new generation to take their next steps forwardin education, careers, or both.</p><p>So, are you ready to unleash your coding superpower and become Captain Code?</p></div></span>",

When used correctly, they meet crucial software requirements with ease and reduce costs. This book will uncover effective ways to use design patterns and demonstrate their implementation with executable code specific to both C# and .NET Core.\n</p><p>Hands-On Design Patterns with C# and .NET Core begins with an overview of object-oriented programming (OOP) and SOLID principles. It provides an in-depth explanation of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral. The book then takes you through functional, reactive, and concurrent patterns, helping you write better code with streams, threads, and coroutines. Toward the end of the book, you’ll learn about the latest trends in architecture, exploring design patterns for microservices, serverless, and cloud native applications. You’ll even understand the considerations that need to be taken into account when choosing between different architectures such as microservices and MVC.\n</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be able to write efficient and clear code and be comfortable working on scalable and maintainable projects of any size.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Make your code more flexible by applying SOLID principles\n</li><li>Follow the test-driven development (TDD) approach in your .NET Core projects\n</li><li>Get to grips with efficient database migration, data persistence, and testing techniques\n</li><li>Convert a console application to a web application using the right MVP\n</li><li>Write asynchronous, multithreaded, and parallel code\n</li><li>Implement MVVM and work with RxJS and AngularJS to deal with changes in databases\n</li><li>Explore the features of microservices, serverless programming, and cloud computing</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you have a basic understanding of C# and the .NET Core framework, this book will help you write code that is easy to reuse and maintain with the help of proven design patterns that you can implement in your code.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this ebook: You can download the example code files for this ebook on GitHub at the following link: \n\t\t<a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Design-Patterns-with-C-and-.NET-Core\">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Design-Patterns-with-C-and-.NET-Core</a>.

			"description": "<span><div><p>Architects of buildings and architects of software have more in common than most people think. Both professions require attention to detail, and both practitioners will see their work collapse around them if they make too many mistakes.  It's impossible to imagine a world in which buildings get built without blueprints, but it's still common for software applications to be designed and built without blueprints, or in this case, design patterns.A software design pattern can be identified as \"a recurring solution to a recurring problem.\" Using design patterns for software development makes sense in the same way that architectural design patterns make sense--if it works well in one place, why not use it in another?  But developers have had enough of books that simply catalog design patterns without extending into new areas, and books that are so theoretical that you can't actually do anything better after reading them than you could before you started.Crawford and Kaplan's <i>J2EE Design Patterns</i> approaches the subject in a unique, highly practical and pragmatic way. Rather than simply present another catalog of design patterns, the authors broaden the scope by discussing ways to choose design patterns when building an enterprise application from scratch, looking closely at the real world tradeoffs that Java developers must weigh when architecting their applications. Then they go on to show how to apply the patterns when writing realworld software.  They also extend design patterns into areas not covered in other books, presenting original patterns for data modeling, transaction / process modeling, and interoperability.<i>J2EE Design Patterns</i> offers extensive coverage of the five problem areas enterprise developers face:</p><ul><li>Maintenance (Extensibility)</li><li>Performance (System Scalability)</li><li>Data Modeling (Business Object Modeling)</li><li>Transactions (process Modeling)</li><li>Messaging (Interoperability)</li></ul>And with its careful balance between theory and practice, <i>J2EE Design Patterns</i> will give developers new to the Java enterprise development arena a solid understanding of how to approach a wide variety of architectural and procedural problems, and will give experienced J2EE pros an opportunity to extend and improve on their existing experience.</div></span>",

			"title": "Refactoring for Software Design Smells",
			"description": "<span>\nAwareness of design smells – indicators of common design problems – helps developers or software engineers understand mistakes made while designing, what design principles were overlooked or misapplied, and what principles need to be applied properly to address those smells through refactoring. Developers and software engineers may \"know\" principles and patterns, but are not aware of the \"smells\" that exist in their design because of wrong or mis-application of principles or patterns. These smells tend to contribute heavily to technical debt – further time owed to fix projects thought to be complete – and need to be addressed via proper refactoring.<br/><br/><i>Refactoring for Software Design Smells</i> presents 25 structural design smells, their role in identifying design issues, and potential refactoring solutions. Organized across common areas of software design, each smell is presented with diagrams and examples illustrating the poor design practices and the problems that result, creating a catalog of nuggets of readily usable information that developers or engineers can apply in their projects. The authors distill their research and experience as consultants and trainers, providing insights that have been used to improve refactoring and reduce the time and costs of managing software projects. Along the way they recount anecdotes from actual projects on which the relevant smell helped address a design issue.<ul><li>Contains a comprehensive catalog of 25 structural design smells (organized around four fundamental design principles) that contribute to technical debt in software projects</li><li>Presents a unique naming scheme for smells that helps understand the cause of a smell as well as points toward its potential refactoring</li><li>Includes illustrative examples that showcase the poor design practices underlying a smell and the problems that result</li><li>Covers pragmatic techniques for refactoring design smells to manage technical debt and to create and maintain high-quality software in practice</li><li>Presents insightful anecdotes and case studies drawn from the trenches of real-world projects</li></ul>\n</span>",

Feature flags are a modern application of this concept, focused on accelerating software delivery. Fast-moving software teams used flags a decade ago to work on half-finished code without disrupting their users. Today, it’s become standard practice for product delivery teams to use flags to deliver functionality in small increments—while learning from their users.</p><p>In this short book, you’ll look learn how teams can successfully apply feature flags—aka toggles, flips, gates, or switches—to accelerate software delivery. You’ll learn about different types of feature flags, and explore critical code-level techniques to keep your feature-flagging code manageable. You’ll also learn how to keep the number of flags in your codebase to a manageable level.</p><ul><li>Use flags in feature management to determine which users are exposed to a given feature</li><li>Examine several cases involving feature flags, including continuous delivery and testing in production</li><li>Learn techniques to ensure that feature-flagged code is readable, maintainable, and testable</li><li>Explore the trends and practices that are driving the convergence of continuous delivery and experimentation</li></ul></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>As a programmer, you need to be able to recognize and improve\nproblematic code, so the program remains in a working state\nthroughout the software lifecycle. Refactoring-the art of improving\nthe design of existing code safely-provides an efficient, reliable\nsystem for bringing order to the chaos, and one that keeps the\nsurprises to a minimum! Refactoring can be difficult to learn, but\nRefactoring Workbook, by consultant William C. Wake, presents the\nmaterial in a easy-learning format that makes learning enjoyable\nand effective.</p><p>For many, the obstacle to learning refactoring is in identifying\nthe \"smells\"—the potential problem areas-found in code.\nInstead of having you read about the smells, Refactoring Workbook\nmakes sure you understand them. You'll solve a carefully assembled\nseries of problems, and you'll find yourself learning at a deeper\nlevel and arriving at a few insights of your own. Wake uses the\nworkbook method—a learning-focused approach that forces you\nto apply the techniques presented in the book-in the rest of the\nbook. This approach helps you learn and apply the most important\nrefactoring techniques to your code and, as a side benefit, helps\nyou to think more about creating great code even when you're not\nrefactoring.</p><p>Refactoring Workbook provides user-friendly references such\nas:</p><li><p>A handy, quick-reference \"smell finder\"</p></li><li><p>A standard format for describing smells</p></li><li><p>Appendices showing key refactorings</p></li><li><p>A listing of Java™ tools that support refactoring</p></li><p>This book is intended for programmers with a knowledge of Java,\nthough a C# or C++ programmer with a basic understanding of Java\nwould also be able to follow and learn from the examples. It can be\nused as a companion to Martin Fowler's Refactoring (also from\nAddison-Wesley Professional), which provides step-by-step\ninstructions for many refactorings.</p></span></span>",

Nowadays, there are so many JavaScript frameworks and libraries created that help readers to create charts, animations, simulations, and so on. By the time a project finishes or reaches a stable state, so much JavaScript code has already been written that changing and maintaining it further is tedious. Here comes the importance of automated testing and more specifically, developing all that code in a test-driven environment. Test-driven development is a methodology that makes testing the central part of the design process ? before writing code developers decide upon the conditions that code must meet to pass a test. The end goal is to help the readers understand the importance and process of using TDD as a part of development.</p><p>This book starts with the details about test-driven development, its importance, need, and benefits. Later the book introduces popular tools and frameworks like YUI, Karma, QUnit, DalekJS, JsUnit and goes on to utilize Jasmine, Mocha, Karma for advanced concepts like feature detection, server-side testing, and patterns. We are going to understand, write, and run tests, and further debug our programs. The book concludes with best practices in JavaScript testing. By the end of the book, the readers will know why they should test, how to do it most efficiently, and will have a number of versatile tests (and methods for devising new tests) to get to work immediately.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Easy-to-follow guide with suitable examples for developing JavaScript code in the test-Driven environment, with popular tools and frameworks.

Knowledge of these design patterns helps developers and professionals to craft software solutions of any scale.</p><p>ASP.NET Core 5 Design Patterns starts by exploring basic design patterns, architectural principles, dependency injection, and other ASP.NET Core mechanisms. You'll explore the component scale as you discover patterns oriented toward small chunks of the software, and then move to application-scale patterns and techniques to understand higher-level patterns and how to structure the application as a whole. The book covers a range of significant GoF (Gangs of Four) design patterns such as strategy, singleton, decorator, facade, and composite. The chapters are organized based on scale and topics, allowing you to start small and build on a strong base, the same way that you would develop a program. With the help of use cases, the book will show you how to combine design patterns to display alternate usage and help you feel comfortable working with a variety of design patterns. Finally, you'll advance to the client side to connect the dots and make ASP.NET Core a viable full-stack alternative.</p><p>By the end of the book, you'll be able to mix and match design patterns and have learned how to think about architecture and how it works.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Apply the SOLID principles for building flexible and maintainable software</li><li>Get to grips with .NET 5 dependency injection</li><li>Work with GoF design patterns such as strategy, decorator, and composite</li><li>Explore the MVC patterns for designing web APIs and web applications using Razor</li><li>Discover layering techniques and tenets of clean architecture</li><li>Become familiar with CQRS and vertical slice architecture as an alternative to layering</li><li>Understand microservices, what they are, and what they are not</li><li>Build ASP.NET UI from server-side to client-side Blazor</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This design patterns book is for intermediate-level software and web developers with some knowledge of .NET who want to write flexible, maintainable, and robust code for building scalable web applications.

The Success Case Method offers a breakthrough evaluation technique that is easier, faster, and cheaper than competing approaches, and produces compelling evidence decision-makers can actually use.<br/><br/>Because it seeks out the best stories of how real individuals have actually used innovations, The Success Case Method can ferret out success no matter how small or infrequent. It can salvage the few \"gems\" of success from a larger initiative that is not doing well or find out how to make a partially successful effort even more successful.

In a well-structured and easy-to-understand way, this book provides a wonderful collection of patterns each addressing a typical set of SOA design problems with well articulated solutions. The plain language and hundreds of diagrams included in the book help make the complicated subjects of SOA design comprehensible even to those who are new to the SOA design world. It’s a must-have reference book for all SOA practitioners, especially for enterprise architects, solution architects, developers, managers, and business process experts.”</p><p><em>- Canyang Kevin Liu, Solution Architecture Manager, SAP</em></p><p>“The concept of service oriented architecture has long promised visions of agile organizations being able to swap out interfaces and applications as business needs change. SOA also promises incredible developer and IT productivity, with the idea that key services would be candidates for cross-enterprise sharing or reuse. But many organizations’ efforts to move to SOA have been mired–by organizational issues, by conflicting vendor messages, and by architectures that may amount to little more than Just a Bunch of Web Services. There’s been a lot of confusion in the SOA marketplace about exactly what SOA is, what it’s supposed to accomplish, and how an enterprise goes about in making it work.</p><p><em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is a definitive work that offers clarity on the purpose and functioning of service oriented architecture. SOA Design Patterns not only helps the IT practitioner lay the groundwork for a well-functioning SOA effort across the enterprise, but also connects the dots between SOA and the business requirements in a very concrete way. Plus, this book is completely technology agnostic—<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> rightly focuses on infrastructure and architecture, and it doesn’t matter whether you’re using components of one kind or another, or Java, or .NET, or Web services, or REST-style interfaces.</p><p>While no two SOA implementations are alike, Thomas Erl and his team of contributors have effectively identified the similarities in composition services need to have at a sub-atomic level in order to interact with each other as we hope they will. The book identifies 85 SOA design patterns which have been developed and thoroughly vetted to ensure that a service-oriented architecture does achieve the flexibility and loose coupling promised. The book is also compelling in that it is a living document, if you will, inviting participation in an open process to identify and formulate new patterns to this growing body of knowledge.”</p><p><em>- Joe McKendrick, Independent Analyst, Author of ZDNet’s SOA Blog</em></p><p>“If you want to truly educate yourself on SOA, read this book.”</p><p><em>- Sona Srinivasan, Global Client Services &amp; Operations, CISCO</em></p><p>“An impressive decomposition of the process and architectural elements that support serviceoriented analysis, design, and delivery. Right-sized and terminologically consistent.</p><p>Overall, the book represents a patient separation of concerns in respect of the process and architectural parts that underpin any serious SOA undertaking. Two things stand out. First, the pattern relationship diagrams provide rich views into the systemic relationships that structure a service-oriented architecture: these patterns are not discrete, isolated templates to be applied mechanically to the problem space; rather, they form a network of forces and constraints that guide the practitioner to consider the task at hand in the context of its inter-dependencies. Second, the pattern sequence diagrams and accompanying notes provide a useful framework for planning and executing the many activities that comprise an SOA engagement.”</p><p><em>- Ian Robinson, Principal Technology Consultant, ThoughtWorks</em></p><p>“Successful implementation of SOA principles requires a shift in focus from software system means, or the way capabilities are developed, to the desired end results, or real-world effects required to satisfy organizational business processes. In <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, Thomas Erl provides service architects with a broad palette of reusable service patterns that describe service capabilities that can cut across many SOA applications. Service architects taking advantage of these patterns will save a great deal of time describing and assembling services to deliver the real world effects they need to meet their organization’s specific business objectives.”</p><p><em>- Chuck Georgo, Public Safety and National Security Architect</em></p><p>“In IT, we have increasingly come to see the value of having catalogs of good solution patterns in programming and systems design. With this book, Thomas Erl brings a comprehensive set of patterns to bear on the world of SOA. These patterns enable easily communicated, reusable, and effective solutions, allowing us to more rapidly design and build out the large, complicated and interoperable enterprise SOAs into which our IT environments are evolving.”</p><p><em>- Al Gough, Business Systems Solutions CTO, CACI International Inc.</em></p><p>“This book provides a comprehensive and pragmatic review of design issues in service-centric design, development, and evolution. The Web site related to this book [SOAPatterns.org] is a wonderful platform and gives the opportunity for the software community to maintain this catalogue….”</p><p><em>- Veronica Gacitua Decar, Dublin City University</em></p><p>“Erl’s <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is for the IT decision maker determined to make smart architecture design choices, smart investments, and long term enterprise impact. For those IT professionals committed to service-orientation as a value-added design and implementation option, Patterns offers a credible, repeatable approach to engineering an adaptable business enterprise. This is a must read for all IT architect professionals.”</p><p><em>- Larry Gloss, VP and General Manager, Information Manufacturing, LLC</em></p><p>“These SOA patterns define, encompass, and comprise a complete repertoire of best practices for developing a world-class IT SOA portfolio for the enterprise and its organizational units through to service and schema analysis and design. After many years as an architect on many SOA projects, I strongly recommend this book be on the shelf of every analyst and technical member of any SOA effort, right next to the SOA standards and guidelines it outlines and elucidates the need for. Our SOA governance standards draw heavily from this work and others from this series.”</p><p><em>- Robert John Hathaway III, Enterprise Software Architect, SOA Object Systems</em></p><p>“A wise man once told me that wisdom isn’t all about knowledge and intelligence, it is just as much about asking questions. Asking questions is the true mark of wisdom and during the writing of the <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> book Thomas Erl has shown his real qualities. The community effort behind this book is huge meaning that Thomas has had access to the knowledge and experience of a large group of accomplished practitioners. The result speaks for itself. This book is packed with proven solutions to recurring problems, and the documented pros and cons of each solution have been verified by persons with true experience. This book could give SOA initiatives of any scale a real boost.”</p><p><em>- Herbjörn Wilhelmsen, Architect and Senior Consultant, Objectware</em></p><p>“This book is an absolute milestone in SOA literature. For the first time we are provided with a practical guide on how the principle centric description of service orientation from a vendor-agnostic viewpoint is actually made to work in a language based on patterns. This book makes you talk SOA! There are very few who understand SOA like Thomas Erl does, he actually put’s it all together!”</p><p><em>- Brian Lokhorst, Solution Architect, Dutch Tax Office</em></p><p>“Service oriented architecture is all about best practices we have learned since IT’s existence. This book takes all those best practices and bundles them into a nice pattern catalogue. [It provides] a really excellent approach as patterns are not just documented but are provided with application scenarios through case studies [which] fills the gap between theory and practice.”</p><p><em>- Shakti Sharma, Senior Enterprise Architect, Sysco Corp</em></p><p>“An excellent and important book on solving problems in SOA [with a] solid structure. Has the potential of being among the major influential books.”</p><p><em>- Peter Chang, Lawrence Technical University</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> presents a vast amount of knowledge about how to successfully implement SOA within an organization. The information is clear, concise, and most importantly, legitimate.”</p><p><em>- Peter B. Woodhull, President and Principal Architect, Modus21</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> offers real insights into everyday problems that one will encounter when investing in services oriented architecture. [It] provides a number of problem descriptions and offers strategies for dealing with these problems. SOA design patterns highlights more than just the technical problems and solutions. Common organizational issues that can hinder progress towards achieving SOA migration are explained along with potential approaches for dealing with these real world challenges. Once again Thomas Erl provides in-depth coverage of SOA terminology and helps the reader better understand and appreciate the complexities of migrating to an SOA environment.”</p><p><em>- David Michalowicz, Air and Space Operations Center Modernization Team Lead,</em></p><p><em>MITRE Corporation</em></p><p>“This is a long overdue, serious, comprehensive, and well-presented catalog of SOA design patterns. This will be required reading and reference for all our SOA engineers and architects. The best of the series so far!</p><p>[The book] works in two ways: as a primer in SOA design and architecture it can easily be read front-to-back to get an overview of most of the key design issues you will encounter, and as a reference catalog of design techniques that can be referred to again and again…”</p><p><em>- Wendell Ocasio, Architecture Consultant, DoD Military Health Systems, Agilex Technologies</em></p><p>“Thomas has once again provided the SOA practitioner with a phenomenal collection of</p><p>knowledge. This is a reference that I will come back to time and time again as I move forward in SOA design efforts.</p><p>What I liked most about this book is its vendor agnostic approach to SOA design patterns. This approach really presents the reader with an understanding of why or why not to implement a pattern, group patterns, or use compound patterns rather than giving them a marketing spiel on why one implementation of a pattern is better than another (for example, why one ESB is better than another). I think as SOA adoption continues to advance, the ability for architects to understand when and why to apply specific patterns will be a driving factor in the overall success and evolution of SOA. Additionally, I believe that this book provides the consumer with the understanding required to chose which vendor’s SOA products are right for their specific needs.”</p><p><em>- Bryan Brew, SOA Consultant, Booz Allen Hamilton</em></p><p>“A must have for every SOA practitioner.”</p><p><em>- Richard Van Schelven, Principal Engineer, Ericsson</em></p><p>“This book is a long-expected successor to the books on object-oriented design patterns and integration patterns. It is a great reference book that clearly and thoroughly describes design patterns for SOA. A great read for architects who are facing the challenge of transforming their enterprise into a service-oriented enterprise.”</p><p><em>- Linda Terlouw, Solution Architect, Ordina</em></p><p>“The maturation of Service-Orientation has given the industry time to absorb the best practices of service development. Thomas Erl has amassed this collective wisdom in <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, an absolutely indispensible addition to any Service Oriented bookshelf.”</p><p><em>- Kevin P. Davis, Ph.D</em></p><p>“The problem with most texts on SOA is one of specificity. Architects responsible for SOA implementation in most organizations have little time for abstract theories on the subject, but are hungry for concrete details that they can relate to the real problems they face in their environment. <em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is critical reading for anyone with service design responsibilities. Not only does the text provide the normal pattern templates, but each pattern is applied in detail against a background case study to provide exceptionally meaningful context to the information. The graphic visualizations of the problems and pattern solutions are excellent supplementary companions to the explanatory text. This book will greatly stretch the knowledge of the reader as much for raising and addressing issues that may have never occurred to the reader as it does in treating those problems that are in more common occurrence. The real beauty of this book is in its plain English prose. Unlike so many technical reference books, one does not find themselves re-reading sections multiple times trying to discern the intent of the author. This is also not a reference that will sit gathering dust on a shelf after one or two perusings. Practitioners will find themselves returning over and over to utilize the knowledge in their projects. This is as close as you’ll come to having a service design expert sitting over your shoulder.”</p><p><em>- James Kinneavy, Principal Software Architect, University of California</em></p><p>“As the industry converges on SOA patterns, Erl provides an outstanding reference guide to composition and integration–and yet another distinctive contribution to the SOA practice.”</p><p><em>- Steve Birkel, Chief IT Technical Architect, Intel Corp.</em></p><p>“With <em>SOA Design Patterns</em>, Thomas Erl adds an indispensable SOA reference volume to the technologist’s library. Replete with to-the-point examples, it will be a helpful aid to any IT organization.”</p><p><em>- Ed Dodds, Strategist, Systems Architect, Conmergence</em></p><p>“Again, Thomas Erl has written an indispensable guide to SOA. Building on his prior successes, his patterns go into even more detail. Therefore, this book is not only helpful to the SOA beginner, but also provides new insight and ideas to professionals.”</p><p><em>- Philipp Offermann, Research Scientist, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany</em></p><p>“<em>SOA Design Patterns</em> is an extraordinary contribution to SOA best practices! Once again, Thomas has created an indispensable resource for any person or organization interested in or actively engaged in the practice of Service Oriented Architecture. Using case studies based on three very different business models, Thomas guides the reader through the process of selecting appropriate implementation patterns to ensure a flexible, well-performing, and secure SOA ecosystem.”</p><p><em>- Victor Brown, Managing Partner and Principal Consultant,</em></p><p><em>Cypress Management Group Corporation</em></p><p>In cooperation with experts and practitioners throughout the SOA community, best-selling author Thomas Erl brings together the de facto catalog of design patterns for SOA and service-orientation. More than three years in development and subjected to numerous industry reviews, the 85 patterns in this full-color book provide the most successful and proven design techniques to overcoming the most common and critical problems to achieving modern-day SOA. Through numerous examples, individually documented pattern profiles, and over 400 color illustrations, this book provides in-depth coverage of: • Patterns for the design, implementation, and governance of service inventories–collections of services representing individual service portfolios that can be independently modeled, designed, and evolved. • Patterns specific to service-level architecture which pertain to a wide range of design areas, including contract design, security, legacy encapsulation, reliability, scalability, and a variety of implementation and governance issues. • Service composition patterns that address the many aspects associated with combining services into aggregate distributed solutions, including topics such as runtime messaging and message design, inter-service security controls, and transformation. • Compound patterns (such as Enterprise Service Bus and Orchestration) and recommended pattern application sequences that establish foundational processes. The book begins by establishing SOA types that are referenced throughout the patterns and then form the basis of a final chapter that discusses the architectural impact of service-oriented computing in general. These chapters bookend the pattern catalog to provide a clear link between SOA design patterns, the strategic goals of service-oriented computing, different SOA types, and the service-orientation design paradigm.</p><p>This book series is further supported by a series of resources sites, including <strong>soabooks.com, soaspecs.com, soapatterns.org, soamag.com,</strong> and <strong>soaposters.com.</strong></p></div></span>",

In <em><b>Test-Driven Database\nDevelopment</b></em>, Max Guernsey, III shows how to adapt TDD to\nachieve the same powerful benefits in database design and\ndevelopment.<br/>\n<br/>\nGuernsey first explains why TDD offers so much potential to\ndatabase practitioners, and how to overcome obstacles such as the\nlack of conventional “testable classes.” You’ll\nlearn how to use “classes of databases” to manage\nchange more effectively; how to define testable database behaviors;\nhow to maximize long-term maintainability by limiting a\ndatabase’s current scope; and how to use “emergent\ndesign” to simplify future expansion.<br/>\n<br/>\nBuilding on this foundation, the author guides you through\nimplementing modern TDD processes and database refactoring. He\npresents practical techniques for improving legacy databases; for\ndeviating from strict TDD when necessary; and for adapting TDD to\napplications that persist data in file systems, XML, or serialized\nobjects. Guernsey shows how to<br/>\n<br/>\n•  Build a simple infrastructure to track and\nstandardize scripts and databases<br/>\n•  Define a sustainable TDD process for database\ndesign<br/>\n•  Safely change a design without losing data<br/>\n•  Design new databases that are lighter, leaner,\nsimpler, more testable, and easier to change<br/>\n•  Reduce design costs by eliminating duplication<br/>\n•  Gradually bring the benefits of TDD, agility, and\nmodern design to legacy databases<br/>\n•  Remediate errors that find their way into database\ndesigns<br/>\n•  Isolate behaviors and avoid unwanted dependencies\nthat cause tests to fail<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this book as a guide, you will learn how to apply the proven\npractice of TDD to your database needs, and organize and optimize\nyour organization’s data for a significant competitive\nadvantage.<br/>\n </p><p><em><b>Test-Driven Database\nDevelopment</b></em><em>is the newest title in the highly respected\nNetObjectives Lean-Agile Series.</em></p></span></span>",

			"title": "Bad Programming Practices 101: Become a Better Coder by Learning How (Not) to Program",
			"description": "<span><div>This book takes a humorous slant on the programming practice manual by reversing the usual approach: under the pretence of teaching you how to become the world’s worst programmer who generally causes chaos, the book teaches you how to avoid the kind of bad habits that introduce bugs or cause code contributions to be rejected.</div><div><br/></div><div>Why be a code monkey when you can be a chaos monkey? OK, so you want to become a terrible programmer. You want to write code that gets vigorously rejected in review. You look forward to reading feedback plastered in comments like \"WTF???\". Even better, you fantasize about your bug-ridden changes sneaking through and causing untold chaos in the codebase. You want to build a reputation as someone who writes creaky, messy, error-prone garbage that frustrates your colleagues. <i>Bad Programming Practices 101</i> will help you achieve that goal a whole lot quicker by teaching you an array of bad habits that will allow you to cause maximum chaos.</div><div><br/></div><div>Alternatively, you could use this book to identify those bad habits and learn to avoid them. The bad practices are organized into topics that form the basis of programming (layout, variables, loops, modules, and so on). It's been remarked that to become a good programmer, you must first write 10,000 lines of bad code to get it all out of your system. This book is aimed at programmers who have so far written only a small portion of that. By learning about poor programming habits, you will learn good practices. In addition, you will find out the motivation behind each practice, so you can learn why it is considered good and not simply get a list of rules.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Become a better coder by learning how (not) to program<br/></li><li>Choose your tools wisely<br/></li><li>Think of programming as problem solving<br/></li><li>Discover the consequences of a program’s appearance and overall structure<br/></li><li>Explain poor use of variables in programs<br/></li><li>Avoid bad habits and common mistakes when using conditionals and loops<br/></li><li>See how poor error-handling makes for unstable programs<br/></li><li>Sidestep bad practices related specifically to object-oriented programming<br/></li><li>Mitigate the effects of ineffectual and inadequate bug location and testing<br/></li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Those who have some practical programming knowledge (can program in at least one programming language), but little or no professional experience, which they would like to quickly build up. They are either still undergoing training in software development, or are at the beginning of their programming career. They have at most 1-2 years of professional experience.</div></span>",

HSA also defines a virtual ISA for parallel routines or kernels, which is vendor and ISA independent thus enabling single source programs to execute across any HSA compliant heterogeneous processer from those used in smartphones to supercomputers.</p><p>The book begins with an overview of the evolution of heterogeneous parallel processing, associated problems, and how they are overcome with HSA. Later chapters provide a deeper perspective on topics such as the runtime, memory model, queuing, context switching, the architected queuing language, simulators, and tool chains. Finally, three real world examples are presented, which provide an early demonstration of how HSA can deliver significantly higher performance thru C++ based applications. Contributing authors are HSA Foundation members who are experts from both academia and industry. Some of these distinguished authors are listed here in alphabetical order: <b>Yeh-Ching Chung, Benedict R. Gaster, Juan Gómez-Luna, Derek Hower, Lee Howes, Shih-Hao HungThomas B.

From that perspective, and in this book, he\noffers insight on how one can and can’t use the UML to move\nto the next level of abstraction in building\nsystems.\"</b></em><br/>\n—Grady Booch</p><p>Experienced application developers often invest more time in\nbuilding models than they do in actually writing code. Why?\nWell-constructed models make it easier to deliver large, complex\nenterprise systems on time and within budget. Now, a new framework\nadvanced by the Object Management Group (OMG) allows developers to\nbuild systems according to their core business logic and\ndata—independently of any particular hardware, operating\nsystem, or middleware.</p><p>Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is a framework based on the\nUnified Modeling Language (UML) and other industry standards for\nvisualizing, storing, and exchanging software designs and models.\nHowever, unlike UML, MDA promotes the creation of machine-readable,\nhighly abstract models that are developed independently of the\nimplementation technology and stored in standardized repositories.\nThere, they can be accessed repeatedly and automatically\ntransformed by tools into schemas, code skeletons, test harnesses,\nintegration code, and deployment scripts for various platforms.</p><p>Written by three members of OMG’s MDA standardization\ncommittee, <em><b>MDA Explained</b></em> gives readers an inside look\nat the advantages of MDA and how they can be realized. This book\nbegins with practical examples that illustrate the application of\ndifferent types of models. It then shifts to a discussion at the\nmeta-level, where developers will gain the knowledge necessary to\ndefine MDA tools.</p><p>Highlights of this book include:<br/></p><li><p>The MDA framework, including the Platform Independent Model\n(PIM) and Platform Specific Model (PSM)</p></li><li><p>OMG standards and the use of UML</p></li><li><p>MDA and Agile, Extreme Programming, and Rational Unified\nProcess (RUP) development</p></li><li><p>How to apply MDA, including PIM-to-PSM and PSM-to-code\ntransformations for Relational, Enterprise JavaBean (EJB), and Web\nmodels</p></li><li><p>Transformations, including controlling and tuning,\ntraceability, incremental consistency, and their implications</p></li><li><p>Metamodeling</p></li><li><p>Relationships between different standards, including Meta\nObject Facility (MOF), UML, and Object Constraint Language\n(OCL)</p></li><p>The advent of MDA offers concrete ways to improve productivity,\nportability, interoperability, maintenance, and documentation\ndramatically.

			"description": "<span><span><p>2012 Jolt Award Finalist!</p><p>Even experienced software professionals find\nit difficult to apply patterns in ways that deliver substantial\nvalue to their organizations. In <b><em>Elemental Design\nPatterns,</em></b> Jason McC. Smith addresses this problem head-on,\nhelping developers harness the true power of patterns, map them to\nreal software implementations more cleanly and directly, and\nachieve far better results. Part tutorial, part example-rich\ncookbook, this resource will help developers, designers,\narchitects, and analysts successfully use patterns with a wide\nvariety of languages, environments, and problem domains. Every bit\nas important, it will give them a deeper appreciation for the work\nthey’ve chosen to pursue.</p><p>Smith presents the crucial missing link that\npatterns practitioners have needed: a foundational collection of\nsimple core patterns that are broken down to their core elements.\nIf you work in software, you may already be using some of these\nelemental design patterns every day. Presenting them in a\ncomprehensive methodology for the first time, Smith names them,\ndescribes them, explains their importance, helps you compare and\nchoose among them, and offers a framework for using them together.\nHe also introduces an innovative Pattern Instance Notation\ndiagramming system that makes it easier to work with patterns at\nmany levels of granularity, regardless of your goals or role.</p><p>If you’re new to patterns, this\nexample-rich approach will help you master them piece by piece,\nlogically and intuitively. If you’re an experienced patterns\npractitioner, Smith follows the Gang of Four format you’re\nalready familiar with, explains how his elemental patterns can be\ncomposed into conventional design patterns, and introduces highly\nproductive new ways to apply ideas you’ve already\nencountered. No matter what your level of experience, this\ninfinitely practical book will help you transform abstract patterns\ninto high-value solutions.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><em>Principles, Process and Practice of Professional Number Juggling</em> (Volume 1 of the Working Guides to Estimating &amp; Forecasting series) sets the scene of TRACEability and good estimate practice<i> </i>that is followed in the other volumes in this series of five working guides. It clarifies<i> </i>the difference between an Estimating Process, Procedure, Approach, Method and<i> </i>Technique. It expands on these definitions of Approach (Top-down, Bottom-up and</p><p>‘Ethereal’) and Method (Analogy, Parametric and ‘Trusted Source’) and discusses how these form the basis of all other means of establishing an estimate.</p><p></p><p>This volume also underlines the importance of ‘data normalisation’ in any estimating procedure, and demonstrates that the Estimating by Analogy Method, in essence, is a simple extension of Data Normalisation. The author looks at simple measures of assessing the maturity or health of an estimate, and offers a means of assessing a spreadsheet for any inherent risks or errors that may be introduced by failing to follow good practice in spreadsheet design and build.</p><p></p><p>This book provides a taster of the more numerical techniques covered in the remainder of the series by considering how an estimator can potentially exploit Benford’s Law (traditionally used in Fraud Detection) to identify systematic bias from third party contributors. It will be a valuable resource for estimators, engineers, accountants, project risk specialists as well as students of cost engineering.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Like any other software system, Web sites gradually accumulate\n“cruft” over time. They slow down. Links break.\nSecurity and compatibility problems mysteriously appear. New\nfeatures don’t integrate seamlessly. Things just don’t\nwork as well. In an ideal world, you’d rebuild from scratch.\nBut you can’t: there’s no time or money for that.\nFortunately, there’s a solution: You can refactor your Web\ncode using easy, proven techniques, tools, and recipes adapted from\nthe world of software development.<br/><br/>\nIn <em><b>Refactoring HTML,</b></em> Elliotte Rusty Harold explains\nhow to use refactoring to improve virtually any Web site or\napplication. Writing for programmers and non-programmers alike,\nHarold shows how to refactor for better reliability, performance,\nusability, security, accessibility, compatibility, and even search\nengine placement. Step by step, he shows how to migrate obsolete\ncode to today’s stable Web standards, including XHTML, CSS,\nand REST—and eliminate chronic problems like\npresentation-based markup, stateful applications, and “tag\nsoup.”<br/><br/>\nThe book’s extensive catalog of detailed refactorings and\npractical “recipes for success” are organized to help\nyou find specific solutions fast, and get maximum benefit for\nminimum effort. Using this book, you can quickly improve site\nperformance now—and make your site far easier to enhance,\nmaintain, and scale for years to come.<br/><br/>\nTopics covered include<br/><br/>\n•    Recognizing the “smells” of\nWeb code that should be refactored<br/>\n•    Transforming old HTML into well-formed,\nvalid XHTML, one step at a time<br/>\n•    Modernizing existing layouts with\nCSS<br/>\n•    Updating old Web applications: replacing\nPOST with GET, replacing old contact forms, and refactoring\nJavaScript<br/>\n•    Systematically refactoring content and\nlinks<br/>\n•    Restructuring sites without changing the\nURLs your users rely upon<br/><br/>\nThis book will be an indispensable resource for Web designers,\ndevelopers, project managers, and anyone who maintains or updates\nexisting sites. It will be especially helpful to Web professionals\nwho learned HTML years ago, and want to refresh their knowledge\nwith today’s standards-compliant best practices.<br/>\nThis book will be an indispensable resource for Web designers,\ndevelopers, project managers, and anyone who maintains or updates\nexisting sites.

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>A Practical Framework for Gaining\nAgility’s Benefits Without the Risk</b></p><p>Agile methodologies, such as XP, Scrum,\nCrystal, and Lean Software Development enable development\norganizations to deliver higher-quality software far more rapidly.\nHowever, for the “non-agile” development organization,\ntransitioning to agility is an enormous leap, requiring radically\nnew skills and presenting profound risks.</p><p>In this book, leading agile practitioner\nCarol A. Wellington introduces the first systematic, three-phase\nprocess for moving smoothly to agility. Just as developers have\nlearned to refactor code to improve performance and\nmaintainability, Wellington shows how to refactor <em>processes</em>\nto improve agility.</p><p>Using Wellington’s framework, you can\ngradually move toward agility, while maintaining full control and\navoiding disruption. You’ll lay a solid foundation for\nagility, and then refactor more and more of your processes,\nsystematically introducing agility wherever it delivers compelling\nvalue. You can retain current processes that work, and implement\nthe best agile methods for your organization, regardless of their\nsource. This practical approach can help you build organizational\nconfidence in agility, drive measurable benefits, and minimize risk\nevery step of the way.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><p>\n·        <em>Phase 1:</em>\nTime-boxed iterations that deliver customer-visible\nfunctionality–not just components</p><p>\n·        <em>Phase 2:</em> A\nlightweight measurement process to detect problems and evaluate\nchanges withoutwasting too much time gathering and analyzing\ndata</p><p>\n·        <em>Phase 3:</em>\nIdentifying your worst process “smells,” uncovering\ntheir true underlying causes, and fixing them</p><p>\n·        Incrementally\nbringing agility to planning, estimation, analysis, design,\ndevelopment, and process management</p><p>\n·        Eliminating tasks\nand processes that don’t add value</p><p>\n·        Overcoming\npitfalls and hidden interconnections that complicate your agile\ntransition</p><p>\n·        Learning to lead\nthe transition to agility, gaining buy-in from team members,\ncustomers, and executives</p><p>Whatever your role, organization, or current\nmethodology, <em>Refactoring to Agility</em> can help you reap\npowerful value from agile methods–without the risks.</p><p><b>Dr. Carol A. Wellington</b> is a\nprofessor of computer science and the department chair at\nShippensburg University of Pennsylvania. Prior to this position,\nshe was a leader in large software development organizations,\nbuilding operating systems and real-time embedded applications. Dr.\nWellington currently uses this combination of academic and\nindustrial experience as a consultant to help companies question\ntheir assumptions about development processes to improve their\nagility and product quality.</p></span></span>",

While their benefits motivate their creation, there are no well-established guidelines for design. This often results in inconsistent behaviors and appearances, even among web applications created by the same company. <br/><br/>Design patterns for web applications, similar in concept to those for web sites and software design, offer an effective solution. In <i>Web Application Design Patterns</i>, Pawan Vora documents design patterns for web applications by not only identifying design solutions for user interaction problems, but also by examining the rationale for their effectiveness, and by presenting how they should be applied.<ul><li>Design interfaces faster, with a better rationale for the solutions you choose.</li><li>Learn from over more than 100 patterns, with extensive annotation on use and extension.</li><li>Take a short-cut into understanding the industry with more than 500 full-color screenshots.</li></ul>\n</span>",

			"title": "Java™ CAPS Basics: Implementing Common EAI Patterns",
			"description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Use Java CAPS to Streamline IT Services and Leverage Legacy\nApplications<br/></b><br/>\nDesign patterns are a useful tool for streamlining enterprise\nintegration and Web development projects: the mission-critical\nprojects that directly impact your competitiveness. <em>Enterprise\nIntegration Patterns</em> by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf\n(Addison-Wesley, 2004) described many of the most useful patterns\nfor enterprise developers. Until recently, however, implementing\nthe patterns in that classic reference required the extensive use\nof raw Java code. Now there’s a better alternative: Using\nSun’s Java Composite Application Suite (Java CAPS),\narchitects and developers can implement enterprise integration\npatterns succinctly, elegantly, and completely.<br/><br/>\nIn <em><b>Java™ CAPS Basics</b></em>, Sun’s own Java CAPS\nexperts show how to quickly put these new tools and technologies to\nwork in your real-world enterprise application integration\nprojects. After reviewing the challenges of enterprise integration,\nthey introduce Java CAPS and show how it can simplify the\ndevelopment of today’s state-of-the-art\n“composite” applications. Next, they bridge the gap\nbetween abstract pattern languages and practical implementation\ndetails. You will learn essential Java CAPS concepts and methods in\nthe context of the patterns you’ll actually use for\nreal-world message and system management.<br/><br/>\nCoverage includes<br/></p><li><p>Comparing approaches to enterprise application integration and\nfinding ways to integrate non-invasively, with fewer changes and\nlower costs</p></li><li><p>Mastering the core integration tools provided by Java CAPS:\neGate, eInsight, eWays and JMS</p></li><li><p>Using enterprise integration patterns to improve application\nreusability, scalability, resilience, security, and\nmanageability</p></li><li><p>Implementing patterns for message exchange, correlation,\ninfrastructure, routing, construction, transformation, and\nendpoints</p></li><li><p>Generating and using cryptographic objects such as X.509\nCertificates, PKCS#12, and JKS Keystores</p></li><li><p>Using advanced techniques such as solution partitioning and\nsubprocess implementation, many of which are covered nowhere\nelse</p></li><li><p>Constructing two complete example solutions that bring together\nmany of the patterns discussed and illustrated in this book</p></li><p><br/>\nThe companion CD contains detailed illustrations for most of the\nrelevant patterns and two complete Java CAPS-based case studies\n(with solutions) that implement a number of the patterns discussed\nin the book. In addition, Part II contains a chapter on\ncryptographic objects used to configure security-related aspects of\nthe suite. It also provides more than sixty detailed examples\ndesigned to illustrate the concepts and patterns presented in this\nbook. Built with JCAPS eDesigner, these graphical, component-based\nexamples can easily be used by business analysts and others with or\nwithout strong coding skills.<br/><br/></p></span></span></span>",

By bringing\ndiscipline and clarity to patterns usage, their techniques enable\nyou to replicate your success broadly and scale patterns to even\nthe largest projects.</p><p>The authors introduce powerful ways to\ndiscover, design, create, package, and consume patterns based on\nyour organization’s experience and best practices. They also\npresent extensive coverage of the nontechnical aspects of making\npatterns work, including a full chapter of guidance on clearing up\nmisconceptions that stand in your way. Coverage includes</p><ul><li><p>Using patterns to optimize the entire development lifecycle,\nincluding design, coding, testing, and deployment</p></li><li><p>Systematically managing the risks and economic returns\nassociated with patterns</p></li><li><p>Effectively implementing PBE roles, tasks, work products, and\ntools</p></li><li><p>Integrating PBE with existing development processes, including\neXtreme Programming, Scrum, and OpenUP</p></li><li><p>Using Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) with patterns</p></li></ul><p>Whether you’re an architect, designer,\ndeveloper, analyst, project manager, or process engineer,\n<b><em>Patterns-Based Engineering</em></b> will help you to\nconsistently derive greater business value and agility from\npatterns.</p></span>",

Through\nexample-based teaching, <em><b>The Joy of Patterns</b></em> reveals\nthe essence of design patterns as an advanced language for\ndescribing system design. This book illustrates how to build more\nefficient, robust, and reusable designs with this powerful\nprogramming paradigm.</p><p>Design patterns have been used as integral techniques for\ncreating better software, but getting started with design patterns\nhas never been easy. Beginning with a description of the rationale\nbehind design patterns, the discussion moves on to an overview of\nthe basic pattern form, and then to a brief review of\nobject-oriented concepts. Following this crucial background, the\nauthor presents a series of system design examples from initial\nconception all the way through code, discussing key design goals\nand the pros and cons of using various design patterns. Code is\npresented in Java, C++, and Visual Basic. The reader will gain\ninsight into the inherent forces at work in the application design\nand the most effective application of numerous core design patterns\nas solutions to recurring programming problems.</p><p>You will read and learn about such important ideas and topics\nas:</p><li><p>Patterns as the language of design and the building blocks of\narchitecture</p></li><li><p>The value and use of many standard patterns in system\ndesign</p></li><li><p>Extensible software development and change management</p></li><li><p>Utilizing supporting patterns to prevent loose ends</p></li><li><p>Testing and deploying new behaviors</p></li><li><p>Understanding requirements and creating hinge points for\nentities that are likely to change</p></li><p><b><em>The Joy of Patterns</em></b> examines the relationship\nbetween specific programming languages and language-independent\ndesign patterns. It also looks at the role of patterns in building\nsystems from scratch through system maintenance and product\nevolution.</p><p>With the background and deeper understanding harnessed from this\nbook, you will have the ability to unleash the considerable power\nof design patterns and enhance the quality of your programming\nefforts.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201657597B09072001</p></span></span></span></span>",
