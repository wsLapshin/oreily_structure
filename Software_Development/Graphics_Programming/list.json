			"description": "<span><div><p>Computer graphics are at work everywhere today, adding eye-popping details to video games, hyper-realistic CGI to major blockbusters, and life-like imagery to computer-animated films. This beginners book will introduce you to a core slice of this ever-expanding field, 3D rendering, with a focus on two popular algorithmic methods: raytracing and rasterization.</p><p>Written to be easily understood by high-school students but rigorous enough for professional engineers, you’ll build each of these surprisingly simple algorithms into complete, fully functional renderers as you build your knowledge base. The first half covers raytracing, which simulates rays of light as they bounce off of objects in a scene; the second half breaks down rasterization, the real-time process for converting 3D graphics into a screen-compatible array of 2D pixels. Every chapter gives you something visually new and exciting to add to your works-in-progress, from creating reflections and shadows that make objects look more realistic, to rendering a scene from any directional point of view.</p><p>You’ll learn how to:</p><p>•Represent objects in a scene, and use perspective projection to draw them in<br/>•Compute the illumination for light sources (point, directional, and ambient)<br/>•Render mirror-like reflections on surfaces, and cast shadows for depth<br/>•Use clipping algorithms to render a scene from any camera position<br/>•Implement flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading algorithms<br/>•\"\"Paint” textures that fake surface details and turn shapes into everyday objects</p><p>The book uses informal pseudocode throughout the text, so you can write your renderers in any language. In addition, the author provides links to live working versions of his algorithms.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b><i>Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice, Third Edition,</i></b> remains the most authoritative introduction to the field. The first edition, the original “Foley and van Dam,” helped to define computer graphics and how it could be taught. The second edition became an even more comprehensive resource for practitioners and students alike. This third edition has been completely rewritten to provide detailed and up-to-date coverage of key concepts, algorithms, technologies, and applications.</p><p>The authors explain the principles, as well as the mathematics, underlying computer graphics–knowledge that is essential for successful work both now and in the future. Early chapters show how to create 2D and 3D pictures right away, supporting experimentation. Later chapters, covering a broad range of topics, demonstrate more sophisticated approaches. Sections on current computer graphics practice show how to apply given principles in common situations, such as how to approximate an ideal solution on available hardware, or how to represent a data structure more efficiently. Topics are reinforced by exercises, program­ming problems, and hands-on projects.</p><p>This revised edition features</p><ul><li>New coverage of the rendering equation, GPU architecture considerations, and importance- sampling in physically based rendering</li><li>An emphasis on modern approaches, as in a new chapter on probability theory for use in Monte-Carlo rendering</li><li>Implementations of GPU shaders, software rendering, and graphics-intensive 3D interfaces</li><li>3D real-time graphics platforms–their design goals and trade-offs–including new mobile and browser platforms</li><li>Programming and debugging approaches unique to graphics development </li></ul><p>The text and hundreds of figures are presented in full color throughout the book. Programs are written in C++, C#, WPF, or pseudocode–whichever language is most effective for a given example. Source code and figures from the book, testbed programs, and additional content will be available from the authors' website (<a href=\"http://cgpp.net/\">cgpp.net</a>) or the publisher's website  (<a href=\"http://informit.com/title/9780321399526\">informit.com/title/9780321399526</a>). Instructor resources will be available from the publisher. The wealth of information in this book makes it the essential resource for anyone working in or studying any aspect of computer graphics.</p></span>",

			"title": "The Ray Tracer Challenge",
			"description": "<span><div><p>Brace yourself for a fun challenge: build a photorealistic 3D renderer from scratch! It's easier than you think. In just a couple of weeks, build a ray-tracer that renders beautiful scenes with shadows, reflections, brilliant refraction effects, and subjects composed of various graphics primitives: spheres, cubes, cylinders, triangles, and more. With each chapter, implement another piece of the puzzle and move the renderer that much further forward. Do all of this in whichever language and environment you prefer, and do it entirely test-first, so you know it's correct. Recharge yourself with this project's immense potential for personal exploration, experimentation, and discovery.</p><p>The renderer is a ray tracer, which means it simulates the physics of light by tracing the path of light rays around your scene. Each exciting chapter presents a bite-sized piece of the puzzle, building on earlier chapters and setting the stage for later ones. Requirements are given in plain English, which you translate into tests and code. When the project is complete, look back and realize you've built an entire system test-first!</p><p>There's no research necessary -- all the necessary formulas and algorithms are presented and illustrated right here. Dive into intriguing topics from fundamental concepts such as vectors and matrices; to the algorithms that simulate the intersection of light rays with spheres, planes, cubes, cylinders, and triangles; to geometric patterns such as checkers and rings. Lighting and shading effects, such as shadows and reflections, make your scenes come to life, and constructive solid geometry (CSG) enables you to combine your graphics primitives in simple ways to produce complex shapes.</p><p>Play and experiment as you discover the fun of writing a ray tracer. Accept the challenge today!</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p><br/><br/>Aside from a computer, operating system, and programming environment, you'll need a way to display PPM image files. On Windows, programs like Photoshop will work, or free programs like IrfanView. On Mac, no special software is needed, as Preview can open PPM files.</p></div></span>",

OpenGL Shading Language (abbreviated: GLSL or GLslang), is a high-level shading language based on the syntax of the C programming language.With GLSL you can execute code on your GPU (aka graphics card). More sophisticated effects can be achieved with this technique.</p><p>Therefore, knowing how OpenGL works and how each shader type interacts with each other, as well as how they are integrated into the system, is imperative for graphic programmers. This knowledge is crucial in order to be familiar with the mechanisms for rendering 3D objects.</p><p>GLSL Essentials is the only book on the market that teaches you about shaders from the very beginning. It shows you how graphics programming has evolved, in order to understand why you need each stage in the Graphics Rendering Pipeline, and how to manage it in a simple but concise way. This book explains how shaders work in a step-by-step manner, with an explanation of how they interact with the application assets at each stage.</p><p>This book will take you through the graphics pipeline and will describe each section in an interactive and clear way. You will learn how the OpenGL state machine works and all its relevant stages. Vertex shaders, fragment shaders, and geometry shaders will be covered, as well some use cases and an introduction to the math needed for lighting algorithms or transforms. Generic GPU programming (GPGPU) will also be covered.</p><p>After reading GLSL Essentials you will be ready to generate any rendering effect you need.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>An Innovative Approach to Multidimensional Signals and Systems Theory for Image and Video Processing</b></p><p>In this volume, Eric Dubois further develops the theory of multi-D signal processing wherein input and output are vector-value signals. With this framework, he introduces the reader to crucial concepts in signal processing such as continuous- and discrete-domain signals and systems, discrete-domain periodic signals, sampling and reconstruction, light and color, random field models, image representation and more. </p><p>While most treatments use normalized representations for non-rectangular sampling, this approach obscures much of the geometrical and scale information of the signal. In contrast, Dr. Dubois uses actual units of space-time and frequency. Basis-independent representations appear as much as possible, and the basis is introduced where needed to perform calculations or implementations. Thus, lattice theory is developed from the beginning and rectangular sampling is treated as a special case. This is especially significant in the treatment of color and color image processing and for discrete transform representations based on symmetry groups, including fast computational algorithms. Other features include:</p><ul><li>An entire chapter on lattices, giving the reader a thorough grounding in the use of lattices in signal processing</li><li>Extensive treatment of lattices as used to describe discrete-domain signals and signal periodicities</li><li>Chapters on sampling and reconstruction, random field models, symmetry invariant signals and systems and multidimensional Fourier transformation properties</li><li>Supplemented throughout with MATLAB examples and accompanying downloadable source code</li></ul><p>Graduate and doctoral students as well as senior undergraduates and professionals working in signal processing or video/image processing and imaging will appreciate this fresh approach to multidimensional signals and systems theory, both as a thorough introduction to the subject and as inspiration for future research.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Continuing in the footsteps of the pioneering first edition, <strong>Signal and Image Processing for Remote Sensing, Second Edition</strong> explores the most up-to-date signal and image processing methods for dealing with remote sensing problems. Although most data from satellites are in image form, signal processing can contribute significantly in extracting information from remotely sensed waveforms or time series data. This book combines both, providing a unique balance between the role of signal processing and image processing. </p><p>Featuring contributions from worldwide experts, this book continues to emphasize mathematical approaches. Not limited to satellite data, it also considers signals and images from hydroacoustic, seismic, microwave, and other sensors. Chapters cover important topics in signal and image processing and discuss techniques for dealing with remote sensing problems. Each chapter offers an introduction to the topic before delving into research results, making the book accessible to a broad audience.</p><p>This second edition reflects the considerable advances that have occurred in the field, with 23 of 27 chapters being new or entirely rewritten. Coverage includes new mathematical developments such as compressive sensing, empirical mode decomposition, and sparse representation, as well as new component analysis methods such as non-negative matrix and tensor factorization. The book also presents new experimental results on SAR and hyperspectral image processing.</p><p>The emphasis is on mathematical techniques that will far outlast the rapidly changing sensor, software, and hardware technologies. Written for industrial and academic researchers and graduate students alike, this book helps readers connect the \"dots\" in image and signal processing. </p><p><strong>New in This Edition</strong></p><p>The second edition includes four chapters from the first edition, plus 23 new or entirely rewritten chapters, and 190 new figures. New topics covered include:</p><ul><li>Compressive sensing</li><li>The mixed pixel problem with hyperspectral images</li><li>Hyperspectral image (HSI) target detection and classification based on sparse representation</li><li>An ISAR technique for refocusing moving targets in SAR images</li><li>Empirical mode decomposition for signal processing</li><li>Feature extraction for classification of remote sensing signals and images</li><li>Active learning methods in classification of remote sensing images</li><li>Signal subspace identification of hyperspectral data</li><li>Wavelet-based multi/hyperspectral image restoration and fusion</li></ul><p>The second edition is not intended to replace the first edition entirely and readers are encouraged to read both editions of the book for a more complete picture of signal and image processing in remote sensing.

However, the increasing demands for fidelity coupled with rapid advances in hardware architecture pose a challenge: how do you find optimal, sustainable solutions to accommodate both speed of rendering and quality? <strong>Real-Time Rendering: Computer Graphics with Control Engineering </strong>presents a novel framework for solving the perennial challenge of resource allocation and the trade-off between quality and speed in interactive computer graphics rendering. </p><p/><p>Conventional approaches are mainly based on heuristics and algorithms, are largely application specific, and offer fluctuating performance, particularly as applications become more complex. The solution proposed by the authors draws on powerful concepts from control engineering to address these shortcomings. Expanding the horizon of real-time rendering techniques, this book:</p><p/><ul><p>\n</p><li>Explains how control systems work with real-time computer graphics </li><li>Proposes a data-driven modelling approach that more accurately represents the system behaviour of the rendering process</li><li>Develops a control system strategy for linear and non-linear models using proportional, integral, derivative (PID) and fuzzy control techniques</li><li>Uses real-world data from rendering applications in proof-of-concept experiments</li><li>Compares the proposed solution to existing techniques</li><li>Provides practical details on implementation, including references to tools and source code</li><p/></ul><p/><p>This pioneering work takes a major step forward by applying control theory in the context of a computer graphics system.

With that in mind, <b>Introduction to Digital Image Processing</b> is simpler in terms of mathematical derivations and eliminates derivations of advanced subjects. Most importantly, the textbook contains an extensive set of programming exercises for students.<br/><br/>The textbook examines the basic technologies needed to support image processing applications, including the characterization of continuous images, image sampling and quantization techniques, and two-dimensional signal processing techniques. It then covers the two principle areas of image processing: image enhancement and restoration techniques and extraction of information from an image. It concludes with discussions of image and video compression.<b/></p><p/><ul><p>\n</p><li>Covers the mathematical representation of continuous images and discrete images</li><li>Discusses the psychophysical properties of human vision</li><li>Analyzes and compares linear processing techniques implemented by direct convolution and Fourier domain filtering</li><li>Details restoration models, point and spatial restoration and geometrical image modification</li><li>Includes morphological image processing, edge detection, image feature extraction, image segmentation, object shape analysis, and object detection</li><li>Describes coding technique applicable to still image and video coding based upon point and spatial processing</li><li>Outlines the widely adopted JPEG and MPEG still image and video coding standards</li></ul><p>The author’s accessible style provides historical background on the development of image processing techniques as well as a theoretical exposition.

			"description": "<span><p>Focusing on mathematical methods in computer tomography, <strong>Image Processing: Tensor Transform and Discrete Tomography with MATLAB® </strong>introduces novel approaches to help in solving the problem of image reconstruction on the Cartesian lattice. Specifically, it discusses methods of image processing along parallel rays to more quickly and accurately reconstruct images from a finite number of projections, thereby avoiding overradiation of the body during a computed tomography (CT) scan.</p><p/><p>The book presents several new ideas, concepts, and methods, many of which have not been published elsewhere. New concepts include methods of transferring the geometry of rays from the plane to the Cartesian lattice, the point map of projections, the particle and its field function, and the statistical model of averaging. The authors supply numerous examples, MATLAB®-based programs, end-of-chapter problems, and experimental results of implementation.</p><p/><p>The main approach for image reconstruction proposed by the authors differs from existing methods of back-projection, iterative reconstruction, and Fourier and Radon filtering. In this book, the authors explain how to process each projection by a system of linear equations, or linear convolutions, to calculate the corresponding part of the 2-D tensor or paired transform of the discrete image. They then describe how to calculate the inverse transform to obtain the reconstruction. The proposed models for image reconstruction from projections are simple and result in more accurate reconstructions.</p><p/><p>Introducing a new theory and methods of image reconstruction, this book provides a solid grounding for those interested in further research and in obtaining new results. It encourages readers to develop effective applications of these methods in CT.</p></span>",

MVIS can be applicable in industry, governmental, defense, aerospace, remote sensing, medical, and academic/education applications but constraints are different. MVIS entails acceptable accuracy, high reliability, high robustness, and low cost. Image processing is a well-defined transformation between human vision and image digitization, and their techniques are the foremost way to experiment in the MVIS. The digital image technique furnishes improved pictorial information by processing the image data through machine vision perception. Digital image pro­cessing has widely been used in MVIS applications and it can be employed to a wide diversity of problems particularly in Non-Destructive testing (NDT), presence/absence detection, defect/fault detection (weld, textile, tiles, wood, etc.,), automated vision test &amp; measurement, pattern matching, optical character recognition &amp; verification (OCR/OCV), barcode reading and traceability, medical diagnosis, weather forecasting, face recognition, defence and space research, etc. This edited book is designed to address various aspects of recent methodologies, concepts and research plan out to the readers for giving more depth insights for perusing research on machine vision using image processing techniques.</p></span>",

Ideal for self study, <strong>The Image Processing Handbook, Sixth Edition</strong>, first published in 1992, raises the bar once again as the gold-standard reference on this subject. Using extensive new illustrations and diagrams, it offers a logically organized exploration of the important relationship between 2D images and the 3D structures they reveal.</p><p/><p><strong><em>Provides Hundreds of Visual Examples in FULL COLOR!</em></strong></p><p>The author focuses on helping readers visualize and compare processing and measurement operations and how they are typically combined in fields ranging from microscopy and astronomy to real-world scientific, industrial, and forensic applications. Presenting methods in the order in which they would be applied in a typical workflow—from acquisition to interpretation—this book compares a wide range of algorithms used to:</p><ul><ul><p/></ul><li>Improve the appearance, printing, and transmission of an image</li><li>Prepare images for measurement of the features and structures they reveal</li><li>Isolate objects and structures, and measure their size, shape, color, and position</li><li>Correct defects and deal with limitations in images</li><li>Enhance visual content and interpretation of details<br/></li></ul><p>This handbook avoids dense mathematics, instead using new practical examples that better convey essential principles of image processing. This approach is more useful to develop readers’ grasp of how and why to apply processing techniques and ultimately process the mathematical foundations behind them.</p><p/><p>Much more than just an arbitrary collection of algorithms, this is the rare book that goes beyond mere image improvement, presenting a wide range of powerful example images that illustrate techniques involved in color processing and enhancement. Applying his 50-year experience as a scientist, educator, and industrial consultant, John Russ offers the benefit of his image processing expertise for fields ranging from astronomy and biomedical research to food science and forensics. His valuable insights and guidance continue to make this handbook a must-have reference.</p></span>",

			"title": "Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets: Applications to Signal and Image Processing",
			"description": "<span><span><p><b>A thorough guide to the classical and contemporary mathematical methods of modern signal and image processing</b></p><p><b><em>Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets</em></b> presents a thorough introduction to the mathematical foundations of signal and image processing. Key concepts and applications are addressed in a thought-provoking manner and are implemented using vector, matrix, and linear algebra methods. With a balanced focus on mathematical theory and computational techniques, this self-contained book equips readers with the essential knowledge needed to transition smoothly from mathematical models to practical digital data applications.</p><p>The book first establishes a complete vector space and matrix framework for analyzing signals and images. Classical methods such as the discrete Fourier transform, the discrete cosine transform, and their application to JPEG compression are outlined followed by coverage of the Fourier series and the general theory of inner product spaces and orthogonal bases. The book then addresses convolution, filtering, and windowing techniques for signals and images. Finally, modern approaches are introduced, including wavelets and the theory of filter banks as a means of understanding the multiscale localized analysis underlying the JPEG 2000 compression standard.</p><p>Throughout the book, examples using image compression demonstrate how mathematical theory translates into application. Additional applications such as progressive transmission of images, image denoising, spectrographic analysis, and edge detection are discussed. Each chapter provides a series of exercises as well as a MATLAB project that allows readers to apply mathematical concepts to solving real problems. Additional MATLAB routines are available via the book's related Web site.</p><p>With its insightful treatment of the underlying mathematics in image compression and signal processing, <b><em>Discrete Fourier Analysis and Wavelets</em></b> is an ideal book for mathematics, engineering, and computer science courses at the upper-undergraduate and beginning graduate levels. It is also a valuable resource for mathematicians, engineers, and other practitioners who would like to learn more about the relevance of mathematics in digital data processing.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Image Super-Resolution and Applications",
			"description": "<span><p>This book is devoted to the issue of image super-resolution—obtaining high-resolution images from single or multiple low-resolution images. Although there are numerous algorithms available for image interpolation and super-resolution, there’s been a need for a book that establishes a common thread between the two processes. Filling this need, <b>Image Super-Resolution and Applications</b> presents image interpolation as a building block in the super-resolution reconstruction process.<br/><br/>Instead of approaching image interpolation as either a polynomial-based problem or an inverse problem, this book breaks the mold and compares and contrasts the two approaches. It presents two directions for image super-resolution: super-resolution with <em>a priori</em> information and blind super-resolution reconstruction of images. It also devotes chapters to the two complementary steps used to obtain high-resolution images: image registration and image fusion.</p><ul><li>Details techniques for color image interpolation and interpolation for pattern recognition</li><li>Analyzes image interpolation as an inverse problem</li><li>Presents image registration methodologies </li><li>Considers image fusion and its application in image super resolution</li><li>Includes simulation experiments along with the required MATLAB® code</li></ul><p>Supplying complete coverage of image-super resolution and its applications, the book illustrates applications for image interpolation and super-resolution in medical and satellite image processing. It uses MATLAB® programs to present various techniques, including polynomial image interpolation and adaptive polynomial image interpolation. MATLAB codes for most of the simulation experiments supplied in the book are included in the appendix.</p></span>",

These efforts benefit every field in which illustrations—thanks to their ability to clarify, emphasize, and convey very precise meanings—offer advantages over photographs. These fields include medicine, architecture, entertainment, education, geography, publishing, and visualization.<br/><br/><i>Non-Photorealistic Computer Graphics</i> is the first and only resource to examine non-photorealistic efforts in depth, providing detailed accounts of the major algorithms, as well as the background information and implementation advice readers need to make headway with these increasingly important techniques.<br/><br/>Already, an estimated 10% of computer graphics users require some form of non-photorealism.

An entire chapter is devoted to the design of time-continuous filters which provides a useful preliminary step for analog-to-digital filter conversion.</p><p>Attention is also given to the main methods of designing finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. Bi-dimensional digital filtering (image filtering) is investigated and a study on stability analysis, a very useful tool when implementing IIR filters, is also carried out. As such, it will provide a practical and useful guide to those engaged in signal processing.</p></span></span></span>",

By \"image processing\", we generally understand all kinds of operation performed on images (or sequences of images) in order to increase their quality, restore their original content, emphasize some particular aspect of the information or optimize their transmission, or to perform radiometric and/or spatial analysis. By \"image analysis\" we understand, however, all kinds of operation performed on images (or sequences of images) in order to extract qualitative or quantitative data, perform measurements and apply statistical analysis. Whereas there are nowadays many books dealing with image processing, only a small number deal with image analysis.

			"description": "<span>\n    \nAlthough it's true that image compression research is a mature field, continued improvements in computing power and image representation tools keep the field spry. Faster processors enable previously intractable compression algorithms and schemes, and certainly the demand for highly portable high-quality images will not abate. Document and Image Compression highlights the current state of the field along with the most probable and promising future research directions for image coding.<br/><br/>Organized into three broad sections, the book examines the currently available techniques, future directions, and techniques for specific classes of images. It begins with an introduction to multiresolution image representation, advanced coding and modeling techniques, and the basics of perceptual image coding. This leads to discussions of the JPEG 2000 and JPEG-LS standards, lossless coding, and fractal image compression. New directions are highlighted that involve image coding and representation paradigms beyond the wavelet-based framework, the use of redundant dictionaries, the distributed source coding paradigm, and novel data-hiding techniques. The book concludes with techniques developed for classes of images where the general-purpose algorithms fail, such as for binary images and shapes, compound documents, remote sensing images, medical images, and VLSI layout image data. <br/><br/>Contributed by international experts, Document and Image Compression gathers the latest and most important developments in image coding into a single, convenient, and authoritative source.\n\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Vintage-looking, dream-like textures can open up a whole new world in your photography. However, there is much, much more to working with textures than simply merging them with an image via Photoshop. In this gorgeous new guide from texture guru Sarah Gardner, you'll learn everything there is to know about how to maximize the potential of these exciting tools. In addition to hundreds of beautiful example images, this book is also packed with practical advice on what makes a good texture, and how and when to use them. How an image is initially captured and processed has a significant impact on the effect a texture will have, so you'll also learn what to consider when composing and shooting (rather than simply relying on post-processing) and how to use lighting and background considerations effectively for later work with textures. Workshop notes and a supplemental website will help you put Sarah's techniques into practice immediately. Beautiful enough to sit on your coffee table yet practical enough to store near your computer, this book will show you everything you need to know to get that coveted vintage-feel in your images, whether you're a casual family snapper or a seasoned professional. </p></span>",

The authors supply a comprehensive classification system and rigorous mathematical description of advanced and state-of-the-art methods for pansharpening of multispectral images, fusion of hyperspectral and panchromatic images, and fusion of data from heterogeneous sensors such as optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and integration of thermal and visible/near-infrared images. They also explore new trends of signal/image processing, such as compressive sensing and sparse signal representations.</p><p/><p>The book brings a new perspective to a multidisciplinary research field that is becoming increasingly articulate and comprehensive. It fosters signal/image processing methodologies toward the goal of information extraction, either by humans or by machines, from remotely sensed images. The authors explain how relatively simple processing methods tailored to the specific features of the images may be winning in terms of reliable performance over more complex algorithms based on mathematical theories and models unconstrained from the physical behaviors of the instruments.</p><p>Ultimately, the book covers the births and developments of three generations of RS image fusion. Established textbooks are mainly concerned with the earliest generation of methods. This book focuses on second generation methods you can use now and new trends that may become third generation methods. Only the lessons learned with second generation methods will be capable of fostering the excellence among the myriad of methods that are proposed almost every day by the scientific literature.</p></span></span>",

The book shows how image processing has become ubiquitous in movie-making, from shooting to exhibition. It covers all the ways in which image processing algorithms are used to enhance, restore, adapt, and convert moving images. These techniques and algorithms make the images look as good as possible while exploiting the capabilities of cameras, projectors, and displays.</p><p/><p>The author focuses on the ideas behind the methods, rather than proofs and derivations. The first part of the text presents fundamentals on optics and color. The second part explains how cameras work and details all the image processing algorithms that are applied in-camera. With an emphasis on state-of-the-art methods that are actually used in practice, the last part describes image processing algorithms that are applied offline to solve a variety of problems.</p><p/><p>The book is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics, image processing, computer science, and related fields. It is also suitable for academic researchers and professionals in the movie industry. </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Dr Donald Bailey starts with introductory material considering the problem of embedded image processing, and how some of the issues may be solved using parallel hardware solutions. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are introduced as a technology that provides flexible, fine-grained hardware that can readily exploit parallelism within many image processing algorithms. A brief review of FPGA programming languages provides the link between a software mindset normally associated with image processing algorithms, and the hardware mindset required for efficient utilization of a parallel hardware design. The design process for implementing an image processing algorithm on an FPGA is compared with that for a conventional software implementation, with the key differences highlighted. Particular attention is given to the techniques for mapping an algorithm onto an FPGA implementation, considering timing, memory bandwidth and resource constraints, and efficient hardware computational techniques. Extensive coverage is given of a range of low and intermediate level image processing operations, discussing efficient implementations and how these may vary according to the application. The techniques are illustrated with several example applications or case studies from projects or applications he has been involved with. Issues such as interfacing between the FPGA and peripheral devices are covered briefly, as is designing the system in such a way that it can be more readily debugged and tuned.</p><ul><li><p>Provides a bridge between algorithms and hardware</p></li><li><p>Demonstrates how to avoid many of the potential pitfalls</p></li><li><p>Offers practical recommendations and solutions</p></li><li><p>Illustrates several real-world applications and case studies</p></li><li><p>Allows those with software backgrounds to understand efficient hardware implementation</p></li></ul><p><em>Design for Embedded Image Processing on FPGAs</em> is ideal for researchers and engineers in the vision or image processing industry, who are looking at smart sensors, machine vision, and robotic vision, as well as FPGA developers and application engineers.</p><p>The book can also be used by graduate students studying imaging systems, computer engineering, digital design, circuit design, or computer science. It can also be used as supplementary text for courses in advanced digital design, algorithm and hardware implementation, and digital signal processing and applications.</p><p>Companion website for the book: <code>www.wiley.com/go/bailey/fpga</code></p></span></span>",

It then describes the technology and techniques behind projection displays, projector-camera systems, stereoscopic and autostereoscopic displays, computer-generated holography, and near-eye displays.

			"title": "The Digital Zone System",
			"description": "<span><p>There is an ongoing debate among photographers whether digital photography processes will ever be able to reach the pinnacle of image quality and tonality achieved by Ansel Adams decades ago. The Digital Zone System (DZS) is an innovative methodology for editing digital images that mimics the Zone System created by Adams. <br/><br/>With this book, author Robert Fisher presents a practical guide for editing digital images with a level of control previously unattainable without significant manual work. He walks the reader through the background of Adam's original Zone System and points out similarities to current digital processes including Expose to the Right (ETTR) and high dynamic range imaging (HDRI). <br/><br/>Learn to use luminance masks to separate an image into \"one-stop\" zones of brightness, similar to the zones in Adams's Zone System, that can be worked on individually or in groups. This makes the DZS a powerful tool for converting color images to black and white. You will also gain tremendous control over how color is adjusted in your images by learning to isolate and adjust color in specific targeted areas. These DZS processes are quicker and simpler than the tedious work of using global adjustments and painting in layer masks to isolate the effects of an adjustment layer.<br/><br/>In this book, you will learn how to use the Digital Zone System for editing color images, converting images to black and white, and tone mapping HDR images. Also included are brief discussions of color management, setting up Photoshop, printing, and exposure for digital images. <br/><br/>The book is richly illustrated with step-by-step screenshots and stunning example images that show the benefits of the Digital Zone System over commonly used digital editing methods. Once mastered, the DZS will allow you to produce a higher level of quality in your images, at a faster pace and with greater ease than ever before.</p></span>",

			"title": "Binary Digital Image Processing",
			"description": "<span>This book is aimed at faculty, postgraduate students and industry specialists. It is both a text reference and a textbook that reviews and analyses the research output in this field of binary image processing. It is aimed at both advanced researchers as well as educating the novice to this area. The theoretical part of this book includes the basic principles required for binary digital image analysis. The practical part which will take an algorithmic approach addresses problems which find applications beyond binary digital line image processing.<br/>The book first outlines the theoretical framework underpinning the study of digital image processing with particular reference to those needed for line image processing. The theoretical tools in the first part of the book set the stage for the second and third parts, where low-level binary image processing is addressed and then intermediate level processing of binary line images is studied. The book concludes with some practical applications of this work by reviewing some industrial and software applications (engineering drawing storage and primitive extraction, fingerprint compression).<br/><br/><br/>The book:<br/><br/><br/>*  outlines the theoretical framework underpinning the study of digital image processing with particular reference to binary line image processing<br/>*  addresses low-level binary image processing, reviewing a number of essential characteristics of binary digital images and providing solution procedures and algorithms<br/>*  includes detailed reviews of topics in binary digital image processing with up-to-date research references in relation to each of the problems under study<br/>*  includes some practical applications of this work by reviewing some common applications<br/>*  covers a range of topics, organised by theoretical field rather than being driven by problem definitions<br/></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Computer graphics systems are capable of generating stunningly realistic images of objects that have never physically existed. In order for computers to create these accurately detailed images, digital models of appearance must include robust data to give viewers a credible visual impression of the depicted materials. In particular, digital models demonstrating the nuances of how materials interact with light are essential to this capability.</p><p><i>Digital Modeling of Material Appearance</i> is the first comprehensive work on the digital modeling of material appearance: it explains how models from physics and engineering are combined with keen observation skills for use in computer graphics rendering.</p><p>Written by the foremost experts in appearance modeling and rendering, this book is for practitioners who want a general framework for understanding material modeling tools, and also for researchers pursuing the development of new modeling techniques. The text is not a \"how to\" guide for a particular software system. Instead, it provides a thorough discussion of foundations and detailed coverage of key advances.</p><p>Practitioners and researchers in applications such as architecture, theater, product development, cultural heritage documentation, visual simulation and training, as well as traditional digital application areas such as feature film, television, and computer games, will benefit from this much needed resource.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHORS Julie Dorsey and Holly Rushmeier are professors in the Computer Science Department at Yale University and co-directors of the Yale Computer Graphics Group.
