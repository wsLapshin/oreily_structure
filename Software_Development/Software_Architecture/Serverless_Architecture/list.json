Also known as <i>Function as a Service</i>, serverless computing lets developers deploy applications to the cloud without having to provision or manage a server—or pay for a server when it’s not in use. You simply deploy the logic that comprises your application, while your cloud-based serverless provider handles everything else.</p><p>With this practical report, author Raymond Camden shows you how to develop serverless code with Apache OpenWhisk, an open source serverless platform. You’ll also get an introduction to OpenWhisk with Bluemix, a feature of IBM’s cloud platform as a service suite. IBM, a major OpenWhisk supporter along with Adobe and Red Hat, provides an optional, easy-to-use way to deploy and host your OpenWhisk code.</p><ul><li>Get guidelines and rules for building and using actions, OpenWhisk’s version of functions</li><li>Use actions in production with OpenWhisk’s Web Actions, the Bluemix API Management feature, or a REST API</li><li>Combine actions into sequences, enabling several actions to work together in a single function</li><li>Create, manage, and share packages for organizing your OpenWhisk actions</li></ul></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>The serverless paradigm is going mainstream. Major players such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and IBM are among the dozen organizations that now provide serverless compute options in the cloud—also known as Function-as-a-Service. What exactly does the serverless option entail, and how can you gain maximum value from it? This report takes devops practitioners and software architects through several aspects of this new model and shows you how to get started.</p><p>Author Michael Hausenblas explores several use cases where serverless is a great fit—primarily short-running, stateless jobs in event-driven architectures found in mobile or IoT applications. He also provides a guide for migrating from a monolithic application structure to serverless computing.</p><ul><li>Compare serverless computing to related paradigms and technologies such as Platform-as-a-Service and remote procedure calls</li><li>Evaluate the serverless ecosystem, from AWS Lambda and Azure Functions to Iron.io and the Gestalt Framework</li><li>Look at the serverless paradigm from an operational perspective, and learn why you need a strong devops culture</li><li>Get a serverless operations field guide, including a walkthrough example of this paradigm</li><li>Learn how to roll your own serverless infrastructure, rather than rely on the public cloud</li></ul></div></span>",
