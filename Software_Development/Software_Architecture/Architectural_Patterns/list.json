			"description": "<span><div><p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the foundation of modern programming languages, including C++, Java, C#, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby, Objective-C, and Swift. Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP.</p><p>It is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language or a modeling language, and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.”</p><p>Written by a developer for developers who want to improve their understanding of object-oriented technologies, <em>The Object-Oriented Thought Process</em> provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations.</p><p>While programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on the OOP technologies that have survived the past 20 years and remain at its core, with new and expanded coverage of design patterns, avoiding dependencies, and the SOLID principles to help make software designs understandable, flexible, and maintainable.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>A comprehensive guide to exploring modern Python through data structures, design patterns, and effective object-oriented techniques</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Build an intuitive understanding of object-oriented design, from introductory to mature programs</li><li>Learn the ins and outs of Python syntax, libraries, and best practices</li><li>Examine a machine-learning case study at the end of each chapter</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Python Object-Oriented Programming, Fourth Edition dives deep into the various aspects of OOP, Python as an OOP language, common and advanced design patterns, and hands-on data manipulation and testing of more complex OOP systems. These concepts are consolidated by open-ended exercises, as well as a real-world case study at the end of every chapter, newly written for this edition. All example code is now compatible with Python 3.9+ syntax and has been updated with type hints for ease of learning.</p><p>Steven and Dusty provide a comprehensive, illustrative tour of important OOP concepts, such as inheritance, composition, and polymorphism, and explain how they work together with Python's classes and data structures to facilitate good design. In addition, the book also features an in-depth look at Python's exception handling and how functional programming intersects with OOP. Two very powerful automated testing systems, unittest and pytest, are introduced. The final chapter provides a detailed discussion of Python's concurrent programming ecosystem.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have a thorough understanding of how to think about and apply object-oriented principles using Python syntax and be able to confidently create robust and reliable programs.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Implement objects in Python by creating classes and defining methods</li><li>Extend class functionality using inheritance</li><li>Use exceptions to handle unusual situations cleanly</li><li>Understand when to use object-oriented features, and more importantly, when not to use them</li><li>Discover several widely used design patterns and how they are implemented in Python</li><li>Uncover the simplicity of unit and integration testing and understand why they are so important</li><li>Learn to statically type check your dynamic code</li><li>Understand concurrency with asyncio and how it speeds up programs</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you are new to object-oriented programming techniques, or if you have basic Python skills and wish to learn how and when to correctly apply OOP principles in Python, this is the book for you. Moreover, if you are an object-oriented programmer coming from other languages or seeking a leg up in the new world of Python, you will find this book a useful introduction to Python. Minimal previous experience with Python is necessary.</p></span>",

You’ll build on this groundwork by developing buttons, text fields, and other GUI elements that are standard in event-driven environments. You’ll also use many real-world code examples and two pygame-based packages to help turn theory into practice, enabling you to easily write interactive games and applications complete with GUI widgets, animations, multiple scenes, and reusable game logic. In the final chapter, you’ll bring it all together by building a fully functional video game that incorporates many of the OOP techniques and GUI elements covered in the book.</p><p>You’ll learn how to:</p><p>•Create and manage multiple objects using an object manager object<br/>•Use encapsulation to hide the inner details of objects from client code<br/>•Use polymorphism to define one interface and implement it in multiple classes<br/>•Apply inheritance to build on existing code</p><p><i>Object-Oriented Python</i> is a visual, intuitive guide to fully understanding how OOP operates and how you can use it to make your code more maintainable, readable, and efficient—without sacrificing functionality.</p></div></span>",

This one's a\nkeeper.”</em> --Robert C. Martin</p><p><em>“If you want to be an expert in the state of the art in\nTDD, you need to understand the ideas in this\nbook.”--</em>Michael Feathers</p><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is now an\nestablished technique for delivering better software faster. TDD is\nbased on a simple idea: Write tests for your code before you write\nthe code itself. However, this \"simple\" idea takes skill and\njudgment to do well. Now there's a practical guide to TDD that\ntakes you beyond the basic concepts. Drawing on a decade of\nexperience building real-world systems, two TDD pioneers show how\nto let tests guide your development and “grow” software\nthat is coherent, reliable, and maintainable.</p><p>Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce describe the\nprocesses they use, the design principles they strive to achieve,\nand some of the tools that help them get the job done. Through an\nextended worked example, you’ll learn how TDD works at\nmultiple levels, using tests to drive the features and the\nobject-oriented structure of the code, and using Mock Objects to\ndiscover and then describe relationships between objects. Along the\nway, the book systematically addresses challenges that development\nteams encounter with TDD--from integrating TDD into your processes\nto testing your most difficult features. Coverage includes</p><p>•   Implementing TDD\neffectively: getting started, and maintaining your momentum</p><p>    throughout the\nproject</p><p>•   Creating cleaner, more\nexpressive, more sustainable code</p><p>•   Using tests to stay\nrelentlessly focused on sustaining quality</p><p>•   Understanding how TDD,\nMock Objects, and Object-Oriented Design come together</p><p>    in the context of a real\nsoftware development project</p><p>•   Using Mock Objects to\nguide object-oriented designs</p><p>•   Succeeding where TDD is\ndifficult: managing complex test data, and testing persistence</p><p>    and concurrency</p></span>",

You will come across patterns for Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Event-Driven Architecture (EDA), Resource-Oriented Architecture (ROA), big data analytics architecture, and Microservices Architecture (MSA). The final module talks about advanced topics such as Docker containers, high performance, and reliable application architectures. The key takeaways include understanding what architectures are, why they're used, and how and where architecture, design, and integration patterns are being leveraged to build better and bigger systems.</p><p><b>Style and Approach</b></p><p>This book adopts a hands-on approach with real-world examples and use cases.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The Complete Guide to Writing Maintainable, Manageable, Pleasing, and Powerful Object-Oriented Applications</p><p>Object-oriented programming languages have a point of view about how best to model the world. They exist to help you create beautiful, straightforward applications that are easy to change and simple to extend. Unfortunately, the world is awash with object-oriented (OO) applications that are difficult to understand and expensive to change. Even though they’re written in OO languages, these applications fail to achieve the promise of OO because their code doesn’t reflect the right mindset. The purpose of <i><b>Practical Object-Oriented Design, Second Edition,</b></i> is to solve that problem by immersing you in an OO mindset. It teaches powerful, real-world, object-oriented design techniques using simple and practical examples. It will change the way you think about code.</p><p>Sandi Metz has distilled a lifetime of conversations and presentations about object-oriented design into a proven set of OO practices for crafting manageable, extensible, and pleasing code. She demonstrates how to build new applications that can “survive success” and how to repair those that have become impossible to change. Each technique is illustrated with extended examples in the easy-to-understand Ruby programming language, all downloadable from the companion website, <a href=\"http://poodr.com\">poodr.com</a>. Fully updated for Ruby 2.5, this guide shows how to:</p><ul><li>Decide what belongs in a single class</li><li>Avoid entangling objects that should be kept separate</li><li>Define flexible interfaces among objects</li><li>Reduce programming overhead costs with duck typing</li><li>Successfully apply inheritance</li><li>Build objects via composition</li><li>Design cost-effective tests</li><li>Solve common problems associated with poorly designed object-oriented code</li></ul><p>Whatever your previous object-oriented experience, this concise guide will help you achieve the superior outcomes you’re looking for.</p></span>",

The future of business will depend on software agents, mobile devices, public and private clouds, big data, and other highly connected technology. IT professionals will need to evaluate and combine online services into service-oriented architectures (SOA), often depending on Web services and cloud computing. This can mean a fundamental shift away from custom software and towards a more nimble use of semantic vocabularies, middle-tier systems, adapters and other standardizing aspects.</p><p>This book is a guide for the savvy manager who wants to capitalize on this technological revolution. It begins with a high-level example of how an average person might interact with a service-oriented architecture, and progresses to more detail, discussing technical forces driving adoption and how to manage technology, culture and personnel issues that can arise during adoption. An extensive reference section provides quick access to commonly used terms and concepts.</p><ul><li>Broad, non-technical explanation of a technical topic for managers at all levels</li><li>Only web services book to cover data management and software engineering perspectives; excellent resource for all members of IT teams</li><li>Provides a set of leadership principles and suggested applications for using this technology</li></ul></span>",

Ever since I came across it <em>Applying UML\nand Patterns</em> has been my unreserved choice.\"<br/>\n—<b>Martin Fowler</b>, author, <em>UML Distilled and\nRefactoring</em></p><p>The first edition of <em>Applying UML and Patterns: An\nIntroduction to Object-Oriented Analysis and Design</em> quickly\nemerged as the leading OOA/D introduction; it has been translated\ninto seven languages and adopted in universities and businesses\nworldwide. In this second edition, well-known object technology and\niterative methods leader Craig Larman refines and expands this text\nfor developers and students new to OOA/D, the UML, patterns, use\ncases, iterative development, and related topics.</p><p>Put simply, the book shows newcomers to OOA/D how to \"think in\nobjects.\" It does so by presenting three iterations of a single,\ncohesive case study, incrementally introducing the requirements and\nOOA/D activities, principles, and patterns that are most critical\nto success. It introduces the most frequently used UML diagramming\nnotation, while emphasizing that OOA/D is much more than knowing\nUML notation. All case study iterations and skills are presented in\nthe context of an \"agile\" version of the Unified Process -- a\npopular, modern iterative approach to software development.\nThroughout, Larman presents the topics in a fashion designed for\nlearning and comprehension.</p><p>Among the topics introduced in <em>Applying UML and Patterns</em>\nare: * requirements and use cases, * domain object modeling, * core\nUML, * designing objects with responsibilities, * \"Gang of Four\"\nand other design patterns, * mapping designs to code (using Java as\nan example), * layered architectures, * architectural analysis, *\npackage design, * iterative development, and * the Unified Process.\nFor a more detailed list of topics, please see the accompanying\ntable of contents.</p><p><em>Foreword by Philippe Kruchten, the lead architect of the\nRational Unified Process.</em></p><p>\"Too few people have a knack for explaining things. Fewer still\nhave a handle on software analysis and design. Craig Larman has\nboth.\"<br/>\n—<b>John Vlissides</b>, author, <em>Design Patterns and\nPattern Hatching</em></p><p>\"This edition contains Larman's usual accurate and thoughtful\nwriting.

Objects also form the\nbasis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and\nPHP.</p><p>It is of vital importance to learn the\nfundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use\nobject-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design\npractices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a\nshift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP\nshould resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular\nprogramming language (such as Objective-C, VB .NET, C++, C# .NET,\nor Java) or a modeling language (such as UML), and instead first\ntake the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the\nobject-oriented thought process.”</p><p>Written by a developer for developers who\nwant to make the leap to object-oriented technologies, The\nObject-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented\napproach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to\nunderstand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the\ndifference between aggregation and association, and the important\ndistinction between interfaces and implementations.</p><p>While programming technologies have been\nchanging and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts\nremain a constant–no matter what the platform.

			"description": "<span><span><p>Upon completion of an object-oriented design, you are faced with\na troubling question: \"Is it good, bad, or somewhere in between?\"\nSeasoned experts often answer this question by subjecting the\ndesign to a subconscious list of guidelines based on their years of\nexperience. Experienced developer Arthur J. Riel has captured this\nelusive, subconscious list, and in doing so, has provided a set of\nmetrics that help determine the quality of object-oriented\nmodels.</p><p><b>Object-Oriented Design Heuristics</b> offers insight into\nobject-oriented design improvement. The more than sixty guidelines\npresented in this book are language-independent and allow you to\nrate the integrity of a software design. The heuristics are not\nwritten as hard and fast rules; they are meant to serve as warning\nmechanisms which allow the flexibility of ignoring the heuristic as\nnecessary. This tutorial-based approach, born out of the author's\nextensive experience developing software, teaching thousands of\nstudents, and critiquing designs in a variety of domains, allows\nyou to apply the guidelines in a personalized manner.</p><p>The heuristics cover important topics ranging from classes and\nobjects (with emphasis on their relationships including\nassociation, uses, containment, and both single and multiple\ninheritance) to physical object-oriented design. You will gain an\nunderstanding of the synergy that exists between design heuristics\nand the popular concept of design patterns; heuristics can\nhighlight a problem in one facet of a design while patterns can\nprovide the solution.</p><p>Programmers of all levels will find value in this book. The\nnewcomer will discover a fast track to understanding the concepts\nof object-oriented programming. At the same time, experienced\nprogrammers seeking to strengthen their object-oriented development\nefforts will appreciate the insightful analysis. In short, with\n<b>Object-Oriented Design Heuristics</b> as your guide, you have\nthe tools to become a better software developer.<br/><br/>\n020163385XB04062001</p></span></span>",

With a sound understanding of how to approach your goal and what software paradigms to use, you can create high-performing applications quickly and efficiently.\n</p><p>In this two-part book, you'll discover the untapped features of object-oriented programming and use it with other software tools to code fast and efficient applications. The first part of the book begins with a discussion on how OOP is used today and moves on to analyze the ideas and problems that OOP doesn't address. It continues by deconstructing the complexity of OOP, showing you its fundamentally simple core. You'll see that, by using the distinctive elements of OOP, you can learn to build your applications more easily.\n</p><p>The next part of this book talks about acquiring the skills to become a better programmer. You'll get an overview of how various tools, such as version control and build management, help make your life easier. This book also discusses the pros and cons of other programming paradigms, such as aspect-oriented programming and functional programming, and helps to select the correct approach for your projects. It ends by talking about the philosophy behind designing software and what it means to be a \"good\" developer.\n</p><p>By the end of this two-part book, you will have learned that OOP is not always complex, and you will know how you can evolve into a better programmer by learning about ethics, teamwork, and documentation.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Untangle the complexity of object-oriented programming by breaking it down to its essential building blocks\n</li><li>Realize the full potential of OOP to design efficient, maintainable programs\n</li><li>Utilize coding best practices, including TDD, pair programming and code reviews, to improve your work\n</li><li>Use tools, such as source control and IDEs, to work more efficiently\n</li><li>Learn how to most productively work with other developers\n</li><li>Build your own software development philosophy\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is ideal for programmers who want to understand the philosophy behind creating software and what it means to be “good” at designing software. Programmers who want to deconstruct the OOP paradigm and see how it can be reconstructed in a clear, straightforward way will also find this book useful. To understand the ideas expressed in this book, you must be an experienced programmer who wants to evolve their practice.</p></span>",

For the first time we are provided with a practical guide on defining service characteristics and service design principles for SOA from a vendor-agnostic viewpoint. It’s a great reference for SOA discovery, adoptions, and implementation projects.”</p><p><i>–Canyang Kevin Liu, Principal Enterprise Architect, SAP Americas, Inc.</i></p><p>“I liked this book. It contains extremely important material for those who need to design services.”</p><p><i>–Farzin Yashar, IBM SOA Advanced Technologies</i></p><p>“This book does a great job laying out benefits, key ideas and design principles behind successfully adopting service-oriented computing. At the same time, the book openly addresses challenges, risks and trade-offs that are in the way of adopting SOA in the real-world today. It moves away from ivory-tower views of service orientation, but still lays out a strong vision for SOA and outlines the changes necessary to realize the full potential.”</p><p><i>–Christoph Schittko, Senior Architect, Microsoft</i></p><p>“I recommend this book to any SOA practitioner who wishes to empower themselves in making service design real…gives readers the 360º view into service design [and] gives SOA practitioners the depth and understanding needed into the principles of SOA to assist in the design of a mature and successful SOA program.”</p><p><i>–Stephen G. Bennett, Americas SOA Practice Lead, BEA Systems</i></p><p>“SOA projects are most successful when they are based on a solid technical foundation. Well accepted and established design principles are part of this foundation. This book takes a very structured approach at defining the core design principles for SOA, thus allowing the reader to immediately applying them to a project. Each principle is formally introduced and explained, and examples are given for how to apply it to a real design problem. A ‘must read’ for any architect, designer or developer of service oriented solutions”.</p><p><i>–Andre Tost, Senior Technical Staff Member, IBM Software Group</i></p><p>“There are few references for SOA that give you the nuts and bolts and this one is at the top of the list.

Using a working example of an online auction site (oBay), it leads you through key SOA design considerations in implementing a robust solution that is designed for change.</p><p>The final section addresses non-functional considerations and covers the packaging, deployment, and testing of SOA applications. It then details how to secure and administer SOA applications.</p><p>Use and apply the Oracle SOA Suite in the implementation of real-world SOA applications</p></span>",

He explains the roles of individual\nobjects in a complete application, how they react to events and\nfulfill service requests, and how to transform excellent designs\ninto excellent code. Using practical examples based on Eclipse, he\nalso shows how tools can help you work more efficiently, save you\ntime, and sometimes even write high-quality code <em>for</em>\nyou.</p><p>Gast writes for developers who have at least\nbasic experience: those who’ve finished an introductory\nprogramming course, a university computer science curriculum, or a\nfirst or second job assignment.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><p>• Understanding what a professionally\ndesigned object really looks like</p><p>• Writing code that reflects your true\nintentions—and testing to make sure it does</p><p>• Applying language idioms and\nconnotations to write more readable and maintainable code</p><p>• Using design-by-contract to write\ncode that consistently does what it’s supposed to do</p><p>• Coding and architecting effective\nevent-driven software</p><p>• Separating model and view, and\navoiding common mistakes</p><p>• Mastering strategies and patterns\nfor efficient, flexible design</p><p>• Ensuring predictable object\ncollaboration via responsibility-driven design</p><p>Register your product at\n<b>informit.com/register</b> for convenient access to downloads,\nupdates, and corrections as they become available.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>In An Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming, Timothy Budd provides a language-independent presentation of object-oriented principles, such as objects, methods, inheritance (including multiple inheritance) and polymorphism. Examples are drawn from several different languages, including (among others) C++, C#, Java, CLOS, Delphi, Eiffel, Objective-C and Smalltalk. By examining many languages, the reader is better able to appreciate the general principles that lie beyond the syntax of the individual languages. <strong>KEY TOPICS:</strong> This new edition presents examples drawn from a wider range of languages, including Eiffel, CLOS, and Python in addition to the mainstream languages, as well as extensive comparisons between C++, C# and Java. Case studies explore the application of polymorphism in the STL in C++ and the AWT in Java. UML notation and diagrams are integrated and utilized throughout. The book also features advanced sections on design patterns, reflection and introspection, network programming, and the implementation of object-oriented languages. <strong>MARKET:</strong> This book is appropriate for programmers looking to read about the theory behind and functionality of a variety of object-oriented programming languages. It is also useful as a reference.</p></div></span>",

Using JavaScript, you can create interactive web pages along with desktop widgets, browser, and application extensions, and other pieces of software. Object-oriented programming, which is popularly known as OOP, is basically based on the concept of objects rather than actions. </p><p>The first module will help you master JavaScript and build futuristic web applications. You will start by getting acquainted with the language constructs and how to organize code easily. You develop concrete understanding of variable scoping, loops, and best practices on using types and data structures, as well as the coding style and recommended code organization patterns in JavaScript. The book will also teach you how to use arrays and objects as data structures. By the end of the book, you will understand how reactive JavaScript is going to be the new paradigm.</p><p>The second module is an easy-to-follow course, which includes hands-on examples of solutions to common problems with object-oriented code. It will help to identify objects from real-life scenarios, to protect and hide data with the data encapsulation features of Python, JavaScript, and C#. You will discover the advantage of duck typing in both Python and JavaScript, while you work with interfaces and generics in C#. With a fair understanding of interfaces, multiple inheritance, and composition, you will move on to refactor existing code and to organize your source for easy maintenance and extension.</p><p>The third module takes you through all the in-depth and exciting futures hidden behind the facade.

It is a client-server technology -- a way of making programs on two different systems work together like one. The advantage of RPC over other distributing programming techniques is that you can link two systems together using simple C calls, as in a single-system program.</p><p>The most common use for client-server is to combine the graphical display capabilities of a desk-top PC with the database and number-crunching power of a large central system. But peer-to-peer programs can run equally well.</p><p>Like many aspects of Microsoft programming, RPC forms a small world of its own, with conventions and terms that can be confusing. But once you understand the purpose behind each feature, programming with RPC is not difficult. This book lays out the concepts and the programming tasks so that you can use this powerful API.</p><p>Microsoft RPC is a new technology based on the RPC used in the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE). This book builds on O'Reilly's successful DCE series. It provides a solid foundation for programmers learning to use Microsoft RPC, including:</p><ul><li>Controlling communications through the Microsoft Interface Definition Languages (MIDL) and the Attribute Configuration File (ACF)The book contains:</li><li>How the server advertises itself</li><li>How a client chooses a server (binding)</li><li>Types of pointers and arrays</li><li>Memory management</li><li>Administration tasks for an RPC server</li></ul><p>This edition covers version 2.0 of Microsoft RPC.

Objects created for object-oriented programs can easily be reused in other programs, saving man hours of coding in the long run by writing code in a smarter way. This course teaches you object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, in an engaging and interactive way.</p><p>It will show you the object-oriented principles in Java and the best techniques. You’ll start by building objects and classes. Then you’ll learn about Constructors and Deconstructors to call and kill your objects. Further on, you’ll find out about different types of Inheritance and how they are dependent on objects. After that, you’ll learn Polymorphism to process objects differently based on their data types and Abstraction techniques to hide data from a user. Next you’ll learn about exception methods and error handling for efficient coding. Finally, you’ll also learn about Encapsulation with methods and variables to keep the data and the code safe from external interference.</p><p>By the end of the course, you’ll be well-versed with the OOP techniques in Java, which will help you write code better and in a more efficient manner.</p><p>The code bundle for this video course is available at - <a href=\"https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-Java-11\">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Object-Oriented-Programming-with-Java-11</a></p><p>Downloading the example code for this course: You can download the example code files for all Packt video courses you have purchased from your account at <a href=\"http://www.PacktPub.com\">http://www.PacktPub.com</a>.

Now, one of the world’s leading IT innovators explains\nwhat it all means—coherently, thoroughly, and\nauthoritatively.<br/><br/>\nWriting for IT executives, architects, and developers alike,\nworld-renowned expert David S. Linthicum explains why the days of\nmanaging IT organizations as private fortresses will rapidly\ndisappear as IT inevitably becomes a global community. He\ndemonstrates how to run IT when critical elements of customer,\nproduct, and business data and processes extend far beyond the\nfirewall—and how to use all that information to deliver\nreal-time answers about everything from an individual\ncustomer’s credit to the location of a specific cargo\ncontainer.<br/><br/><b><em>Cloud Computing and SOA Convergence in Your\nEnterprise</em></b> offers a clear-eyed assessment of the challenges\nassociated with this new world—and offers a step-by-step\nprogram for getting there with maximum return on investment and\nminimum risk.

Such applications may originate from different vendor, platform, and programming language backgrounds, making successful integration a challenging task.   This book enables you to integrate application systems effectively, using the Trivadis Integration Architecture Blueprint, which is supported by real-world scenarios in which   this Integration Blueprint has proved a success.</p><p>This book will enable you to grasp all of the intricacies of the Trivadis Architecture Blueprint, including detailed descriptions of each layer and component. It is a   detailed theoretical guide that shows you how to implement your own integration architectures in practice, using the Trivadis Integration Architecture Blueprint. The main   focus is on explaining and visualizing the blueprint, including comprehensive descriptions of all of its layers and components. It also covers the more basic features of   integration concepts for less experienced specialists, as well as shedding light on the future of integration technologies, such as XTP and Grid Computing. You will learn   about EII and EAI, OGSi, as well as base technologies related to the implementation of solutions based on the Blueprint, such as JCA, JBI, SCA and SDO.</p><p>The book begins by covering fundamental integration for those less familiar with the concepts and terminology, and then dives deep into explaining the different   architecture variants and the future of integration technologies. Base technologies like JCA and SCA will be explored along the way, and the structure of the Trivadis   Integration Architecture Blueprint will be described in detail, as will the intricacies of each component and layer. Other content includes discovering and comparing   traditional and modern SOA driven integration solutions, implementing transaction strategies and process modeling, and getting to grips with EDA developments in SOA.   Finally, the book considers how to map software from vendors like Oracle and IBM to the blueprint in order to compare the solutions, and ultimately integrate your own   projects successfully.</p><p>A concise theoretical guide to SOA Integration based on real world-examples.

			"description": "<span><span><span><span><span><span><p>Over the last few years, Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition\n(J2EE) technology has emerged and matured as a standard platform\nfor building enterprise applications. While the platform has\nmatured into a solid offering for developing and deploying\nenterprise applications, it does offer its challenges. As\ndevelopers, often we confuse learning the technology with learning\nto design with the technology. In this book, senior architects from\nthe Sun Java Center, Sun's Java consulting organization share with\nthe reader their cumulative design experience with and expertise on\nJ2EE technology.</p><p>The primary focus of the book is on patterns, best practices,\ndesign strategies, and proven solutions using the key J2EE\ntechnologies including JavaServer Pages (JSP), Servlets, Enterprise\nJava Beans (EJB), and Java Message Service (J.M.S) API. Other\nancillary technologies like JDBC and JNDI are also discussed as\nrelevant to their usage in these patterns. The J2EE Patterns\ncatalog with 16 patterns and numerous strategies is presented to\ndocument and promote best practices for these technologies.</p><p>In addition to the patterns and strategies, the book offers the\nfollowing:</p><li><p>Presents various design strategies for the presentation tier\nand business tier design.</p></li><li><p>Identifies bad practices in presentation, business, and\nintegration tiers, and offers directions to remedy them by using\ncertain patterns, strategies, and refactorings.</p></li><li><p>Refactorings for various tiers and mechanics to move away from\na bad implementation to a better solution.</p></li><li><p>Sample code and examples for patterns, strategies, and\nrefactorings.</p></li><p>Core J2EE Patterns delivers:</p><li><p>Proven solutions for enterprise applications</p></li><li><p>J2EE Patterns Catalog with patterns for JSP technology, EJB\ntechnology, and J.M.S.</p></li><li><p>Identifies bad practices and recommends solutions</p></li><li><p>Refactorings to improve existing designs using patterns,\nstrategies, and best practices</p></li><li><p>UML Diagrams illustrate structure and behavior of each\npattern</p></li></span></span></span></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>The Object-Oriented Thought Process</p><p>Third Edition</p><p>Matt Weisfeld</p><p>An introduction to object-oriented concepts\nfor developers looking to master modern application practices.</p><p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is the\nfoundation of modern programming languages, including C++, Java,\nC#, and Visual Basic .NET. By designing with objects rather than\ntreating the code and data as separate entities, OOP allows objects\nto fully utilize other objects’ services as well as inherit\ntheir functionality. OOP promotes code portability and reuse, but\nrequires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Before jumping\ninto the world of object-oriented programming languages, you must\nfirst master <em>The Object-Oriented Thought Process</em>.</p><p>Written by a developer for developers who\nwant to make the leap to object-oriented technologies as well as\nmanagers who simply want to understand what they are managing,\n<em>The Object-Oriented Thought Process</em> provides a\nsolution-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers\nwill learn to understand object-oriented design with inheritance or\ncomposition, object aggregation and association, and the difference\nbetween interfaces and implementations. Readers will also become\nmore efficient and better thinkers in terms of object-oriented\ndevelopment.</p><p>This revised edition focuses on\ninteroperability across various technologies, primarily using XML\nas the communication mechanism. A more detailed focus is placed on\nhow business objects operate over networks, including client/server\narchitectures and web services.</p><p><em>“Programmers who aim to create high\nquality software–as all programmers should–must learn\nthe varied subtleties of the familiar yet not so familiar beasts\ncalled objects and classes. Doing so entails careful study of books\nsuch as Matt Weisfeld’s</em> The Object-Oriented Thought\nProcess<em>.”</em></p><p>–Bill McCarty, author of <em>Java\nDistributed Objects</em>, and <em>Object-Oriented Design in\nJava</em></p><p>Matt Weisfeld is an associate professor in\nbusiness and technology at Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland,\nOhio. He has more than 20 years of experience as a professional\nsoftware developer, project manager, and corporate trainer using\nC++, Smalltalk, .NET, and Java. He holds a BS in systems analysis,\nan MS in computer science, and an MBA in project management.\nWeisfeld has published many articles in major computer trade\nmagazines and professional journals.</p></span></span>",

Managers must manage in the fog of this\ntechnology revolution. Kalakota and Robinson's book provides a lens\nfor managers who want to understand the terminology and take\naction--to grasp the opportunities or defend against the invading\nvirtual competitors. When the history of e-business is\nwritten--perhaps sooner than we think--this book will go down as a\nmanagement landmark that helped clear the fog of mumbo jumbo and\nprovided a beacon through which managers could chart their\ncourse.<br/></em> --Michael Quinn, eStrategy Director, B2B Commerce\nLtd.\n</p><p>To survive and succeed in today's complex business world, all\ncompanies--from established industry leaders to feisty\nupstarts--must develop a strategy that allows them to take maximum\nadvantage of the latest trends in technology. Successful companies\nhave implemented focused e-business strategies to build\ncutting-edge enterprises that serve and retain customers, manage\nsuppliers, and integrate selling chains better than ever before.\nOthers, unfortunately, are lured into ill-fated ventures by the\never-changing roster of buzzwords, fads and analogies.</p><p>A timely follow-up to the best-seller on this crucial topic,\n<b><em>e-Business 2.0</em></b> reveals how managers are rewiring the\nenterprise to take maximum advantage of e-business. Ravi Kalakota\nand Marcia Robinson present an innovative application framework\nthat guides the migration from a traditional business model to an\ne-business model. Drawing on their extensive personal experience\nworking with leading businesses, they provide a clear picture of\nthe benefits and challenges that e-business companies face and\nidentify the fundamental design principles for building a\nsuccessful e-business blueprint.</p><p>This new edition incorporates the latest strategies and\ntechniques gained from the experiences of the first generation of\ne-businesses. In addition to updated information on application\nframework design, the book now features more detail on strategy and\ne-business execution. <b><em>e-Business 2.0</em></b> shows how\ne-commerce has evolved into e-business and identifies the 20 key\ne-business trends that are shaping today's economy. It then\naddresses core application frameworks--customer relationship\nmanagement, selling chain management, enterprise resource planning,\nsupply chain management, e-procurement, and business\nintelligence--and shows how each forms the foundation of an\ne-business strategy.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201721651B06012001</p></span>",

			"title": "SOA Security",
			"description": "<span><p>\nSOA is one of the latest technologies enterprises are using to\ntame their software costs - in development, deployment, and\nmanagement. SOA makes integration easy, helping enterprises not\nonly better utilize their existing investments in applications and\ninfrastructure, but also open up new business opportunities.\nHowever, one of the big stumbling blocks in executing SOA is\nsecurity. This book addresses Security in SOA with detailed\nexamples illustrating the theory, industry standards and best\npractices.\nIt is true that security is important in any system. SOA brings\nin additional security concerns as well rising out of the very\nopenness that makes it attractive. If we apply security principles\nblindly, we shut ourselves of the benefits of SOA. Therefore, we\nneed to understand which security models and techniques are right\nfor SOA. This book provides such an understanding.\n<br/>\nUsually, security is seen as an esoteric topic that is better left\nto experts. While it is true that security requires expert\nattention, everybody, including software developers, designers,\narchitects, IT administrators and managers need to do tasks that\nrequire very good understanding of security topics. Fortunately,\ntraditional security techniques have been around long enough for\npeople to understand and apply them in practice. This, however, is\nnot the case with SOA Security.\nAnyone seeking to implement SOA Security is today forced to dig\nthrough a maze of inter-dependent specifications and API docs that\nassume a lot of prior experience on the part of readers. Getting\nstarted on a project is hence proving to be a huge challenge to\npractitioners. This book seeks to change that. It provides\nbottom-up understanding of security techniques appropriate for use\nin SOA without assuming any prior familiarity with security topics\non the part of the reader.\nUnlike most other books about SOA that merely describe the\nstandards, this book helps you get started immediately by walking\nyou through sample code that illustrates how real life problems can\nbe solved using the techniques and best practices described in\nstandards. Whereas standards discuss all possible variations of\neach security technique, this book focusses on the 20% of\nvariations that are used 80% of the time. This keeps the material\ncovered in the book simple as well as self-sufficient for all\nreaders except the most advanced.\n</p></span>",

State-of-the-art molecular approaches demonstrate the role of bioelectricity in the directionality and speed of cell migration, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and orientation. New information indicates that electric fields play a role in initiating and coordinating complex regenerative responses in development and wound repair and that they may also have a part in cancer progression and metastasis.</p><p/><p>Compiling current research in this rapidly expanding field, <strong>Physiology of Bioelectricity in Development, Tissue Regeneration, and Cancer </strong>highlights relevant, cutting-edge topics poised to drive the next generation of medical breakthroughs. Chapters consider methods for detecting endogenous electric field gradients and studying applied electric fields in the lab. The book addresses bioelectricity’s roles in guiding cell behavior during morphogenesis and orchestrating higher order patterning. It also covers the response of stem cells to applied electric fields, which reveals bioelectricity as an exciting new player in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</p><p/><p>This book provides an in-depth exploration of how electric signals control corneal wound repair and skin re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and inflammation. It also delves into the bioelectric responses of cells derived from the musculoskeletal system, bioelectrical guidance of neurons, and the beneficial application of voltage gradients to promote regeneration in the spinal cord. It concludes with a discussion of bioelectricity and cancer progression and the potential for novel cancer biomarkers, new methods for early detection, and bioelectricity-based therapies to target both the tumor and metastatic cancer cells.</p><p/><p>This multidisciplinary compilation will benefit biologists, biochemists, biomedical scientists, engineers, dermatologists, and clinicians, or anyone else interested in development, regeneration, cancer, and tissue engineering. It can also serve as an ideal textbook for students in biology, medicine, medical physiology, biophysics, and biomedical engineering.</p></span></span>",

This is accomplished by breaking individual units of functionality into services that can then be exposed through open protocols and standards.</p><p>Until recently, many of the software technologies used for developing SOA-based solutions were limited to expensive, commercial offerings. However, that has now changed, and a compelling <em>open source SOA</em> platform can be implemented exclusively with open source products.

Paul\nBrown deftly avoids getting caught in the trap of overstating the\ncase for SOA. Instead, he brings the topic skillfully into focus,\nzeroing in on the concepts that must be understood in order to be\neffective. Paul's purpose, as I've found so often in his\npresentations and conversations, is to get to the core of\nreal-world architectural issues that make the difference between\nsuccess and failure. Paul doesn't sit in an ivory tower\npontificating; he gets right down to the critical issues in order\nto develop effective real-life strategies.\"</em></p><p>--From the Foreword by Jonathan Mack,\nSenior Technical Architect, Guardian Life Insurance Company</p><p><em>\"As Paul Brown explains in this fine\nbook, there is more to software development than just writing code.\nSuccessful software requires deep thought and strategy. It requires\nthe coordination and marshalling of the resources and intellect of\nthe entire company, both business and IT. I learned much from\nreading his manuscript and heartily endorse the finished\nbook.\"</em></p><p>--Dr. Michael Blaha, author and industrial\nconsultant</p><p><em>\"Paul Brown has provided a practical and\nactionable guide that will illuminate the way for Business and IT\nLeaders involved in IT strategy, planning, architecture, and\nproject management. A successful adoption of SOA will touch every\naspect of the business and change the way IT does business. This\nbook does a good job of describing the organizational challenges\nand risks and providing suggestions to manage them. It also dives\ndeeply into the architectural techniques that can be employed in\norder to align the service architecture with the business, thus\nproviding maximum benefit and continued funding for your SOA\ntransformation.\"</em></p><p>--Maja Tibbling, Lead Enterprise Architect,\nCon-way Enterprise Services</p><p><em>\"</em><b>Succeeding with SOA</b><em>achieves where most books on service-oriented architectures\nfail. It accurately describes what practitioners are seeing, as\nwell as why, and gives them practical examples through case studies\nand instruction. Most useful both for those about to take the\nplunge and those who are already soaking.\"</em></p><p>--Charly Paelinck, Vice President,\nDevelopment and Architecture, Harrah's Entertainment</p><p><em>\"This book is a must-read for architects\nand SOA practitioners. It provides an important foundation for a\nSOA strategy. Brown emphasizes the importance of aligning services\nwith their business processes, building capabilities using strong\nenterprise architecture standards, and ensuring an effective\ngovernance process. The book promotes the notion of mutual\ndependency between managing a business using business processes and\nmanaging its IT with SOA. By aligning the two paradigms, a business\ncan become more agile, able to adapt to change both quickly and\neconomically.

In <b><em>Succeeding with SOA</em></b>, Paul Brown shows how\nservice-oriented architectures (SOAs) provide the best structure\nfor such integration: clean, well-defined interfaces between\ncollaborating entities. But even SOAs need to be correctly\nunderstood and implemented to avoid common failures. Drawing on\ndecades of experience, Dr. Brown explains what business managers\nand IT architects absolutely need to know--including critical\nsuccess factors--to undertake this essential work.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><li><p>Setting clear and reasonable expectations for SOA's\nbenefits</p></li><li><p>Understanding why conventional project management techniques\ndon't scale to today's enterprise-wide projects</p></li><li><p>Defining a living roadmap for developing services based on\nbusiness priorities</p></li><li><p>Establishing coherent leadership that brings together business\nexecutives, IT leaders, and the SOA architecture group</p></li><li><p>Using Total Architecture Synthesis (TAS) to rapidly develop\nbusiness processes and information systems together</p></li><li><p>Understanding the central role of architecture--and making sure\nthe right architectural decisions get made</p></li><p>Whether you're a business or technical\nleader, this book will help you plan, organize, and execute SOA\ninitiatives that meet or exceed their goals--now, and for years to\ncome.<br/></p><p><em>List of Figures</em><em><br/>\nList of Tables</em><em><br/>\nForeword</em><br/><em>Preface </em><br/>\nPART I.

			"title": "Service Oriented Java Business Integration",
			"description": "<span><span><span><p><b>In Detail</b>\nThe goal of Java Business Integration (JBI) is to allow\ncomponents and services to be integrated in a vendor-independent\nway, allowing users and vendors to plug and play.\nJava Business Integration (JBI) is a specification aiming to\ndefine a Service Provider Interface for integration containers so\nthat integration components written for these containers are\nportable across containers and also integrate with other components\nor services using standard protocols and formats. JBI is based on\nJSR 208, which is an extension of Java 2 Enterprise Edition\n(J2EE).\nThis book first discusses the various integration approaches\navailable and introduces the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), a new\narchitectural pattern that facilitates integrating services. ESB\nprovides mediation services including routing and transformation.\nJava Business Integration (JBI) provides a collaboration framework\nthat provides standard interfaces for integration components and\nprotocols to plug into, thus allowing the assembly of\nService-Oriented Integration (SOI) frameworks following the ESB\npattern. Once JBI and ESB are introduced, we look at how we have\nbeen doing service integration without either of these using\ntraditional J2EE. The book then slowly introduces ESB and, with the\nhelp of code, showcases how easily things can be done using\nJBI.\n<b>What you will learn from this book?</b>\n\t\t\t</p><ul><li><p>Assembling services and porting them across containers using\nJBI</p></li><li><p>Exposing EJB as a WSDL-compliant service across firewalls</p></li><li><p>Binding remote services to ESB to be consumed internally</p></li><li><p>Exposing local components in ESB like POJO as externally\naccessible WSDL-compliant services</p></li><li><p>Providing a web service gateway for external consumers</p></li><li><p>Accessing web services over a reliable transport channel like\nJMS</p></li><li><p>Implementing web service versioning using ESB</p></li><li><p>Implementing service aggregation at ESB</p></li><li><p>Transactions, Security, Clustering, and JMX in ESB</p></li></ul><b>Approach</b>\nThe book covers all concepts with examples that can be built,\ndeployed, and run by readers using the Apache Ant tool in Apache\nServiceMix, which is an open-source Enterprise Service Bus that\ncombines the functionality of a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)\nand an Event Driven Architecture (EDA).\nThe aim of this book is to prepare an architect or developer for\nbuilding integration solutions using ESB. To that end, this book\ntakes a practical approach, emphasizing how to get things done in\nServiceMix with code. When needed, it delves into the theoretical\naspects of ESB, and such discussions are supplemented with working\nsamples. The book, thus, distils some of the knowledge that has\nemerged over the last decade in the realm of Java Integration.\n<b>Who this book is written for?</b>\nThis book is aimed at Java developers and integration architects\nwho want to become proficient with the Java Business Integration\n(JBI) standard. Readers should have some experience with Java and\nhave developed and deployed applications in the past, but need no\nprevious knowledge of JBI. The book can also be useful to anyone\nwho is struggling to understand ESB and how it differs from other\narchitectures and to understand its position in SOA.\nThis book primarily targets IT professionals in the field of SOA\nand Integration solutions--in other words, intermediate to advanced\nusers. You are likely to find the book useful if you fall into any\nof the following categories:\n<ul><li><p>A programmer, designer, or architect in Java who wants to learn\nand code in JBI or ESB.</p></li><li><p>A programmer, designer, or architect who doesn't normally code\nin Java can still benefit from this book, since we 'assemble\nintegration components' using XML with little to no Java code.</p></li><li><p>An IT Manager or an Officer who knows well about SOA or SOI but\nwant to see something in code (you can adorn your flashy\npresentations with some live code too).</p></li></ul></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Ajax is taking us into the next generation of web applications. Ajax has broken the client-server barrier by decoupling the client from the server, but an Ajax application still needs a server to extract content from. The most effective use of Ajax and the server requires an understanding of REST, an architectural style used to define Web services.</p><p><i>Ajax Patterns and Best Practices</i> explores dynamic web applications that combine Ajax and REST as a single solution. A major advantage of REST is that, like Ajax, it can be used with today's existing technologies.</p><p>This is an ideal book whether or not you have already created an Ajax application. Because the book outlines various patterns and best practices, you can quickly check and verify that you're building an efficient Ajax application.</p><p>Inside the book, the patterns will answer the following questions:</p><ul><li><p>What is Ajax, and REST, and why do you even care? And if I should care what are some examples of websites that make effective use of Ajax and REST?</p></li><li><p>What are the absolute basics of Ajax and REST and what parts of those basics should I use?</p></li><li><p>How should deal with large amounts of data? Should I cache the data? Should I get the data piece fed to me? (Patterns: Cache Controller, and Infinite Data)</p></li><li><p>People keep telling me that sessions and cookies are bad? Are they bad? What should I do? And while I think about how about generating content for other devices? (Permutations pattern)</p></li><li><p>I want to fix the back-button problem of the HTML browser. (State Navigation pattern)</p></li><li><p>What is the best way to create a mashup? (REST Based Model View Controller pattern)</p></li><li><p>My page has so many links managed by JavaScript, and I am losing control, help me make this more organized! (Decoupled Navigation pattern)</p></li><li><p>I understand that HTTP means I send data to the server, how about the server sending me some data without asking for it? (Persistent Communications pattern)</p></li><li><p>My server side code looks like a mess with tags and code pieces everywhere. How can I organize and make my HTML page behave like a SOA client and use REST based web services? (Content chunking pattern)</p></li></ul></span>",

The book demonstrates that SOA is not limited to technical issues but instead, is a holistic challenge where aspects of SOA, EDA, and BPM must be addressed together. An ideal guide for SOA solution architects, designers, developers, managers, and students about to enter the field, the book: Provides an accessible introduction to basic and more advanced concepts in process-driven SOA Illustrates how to manage the complexities of business aligned IT architectures with detailed examples and industry cases Outlines a step-by-step design process using proven patterns to address complex business/ technical scenarios Integrates SOA, BPM, and EDA into practical patterns promoting SOA 2.0 Describing how to synchronize parallel enterprise processes, the authors explain how to cope with the architectural and design decisions you are likely to encounter when designing and implementing process-driven SOA systems. The decisions are described in the form of software patterns to provide you with a practical guideline for addressing key problems using time-tested solutions.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span>\nSuccessful businesses and organizations are continually looking for ways to improve service and customer satisfaction in order to achieve long-term customer loyalty. In light of these goals, software developers must ask the question: how does customer orientation influence traditional approaches, methods, and principles of software development? In this book, a leading software architect and his team of software engineers describe how the idea of customer orientation in an organization leads to the creation of application-oriented software. This book describes what application-oriented software development is and how it can be conceptually and constructively designed with object-oriented techniques. It goes further to describe how to best fit together the many different methodologies and techniques that have been created for object-orientation (such as frameworks, platforms, components, UML, Unified Process, design patterns, and eXtreme Programming) to design and build software for real projects. This book brings together the best of research, development, and day-to-day project work to the task of building large software systems.<br/><br/>*Written by and for developers of large, interactive, and long-lived software systems<br/>*Includes patterns of proven analysis, design, and documentation techniques<br/>*Shows how to develop an appropriate design approach and concrete software development techniques\n</span>",

SOA involves a new vision of\nhow to design, develop, and manage applications. It also has new\nrequirements when building an architecture for the underlying\ninfrastructure.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks publication is the result of a project managed\nin the IBM European Design Center, based in Montpellier, France.\nThe scope of the project involved helping a major worldwide\ncustomer in the automotive industry to validate and justify an SOA\nimplementation. In particular, the customer wanted to add new\nbusiness values to work with its partners, by adding new data\nmodels. It also wanted to modernize an infrastructure, by adding\nnew Internet interfaces. The customer faced the need to eradicate\nan obsolete programming language. Furthermore, it wanted to build a\nsmooth migration path, with as few risks and costs as possible.</p><p>The thought, planning, and architecture of the new system, which\nincluded integration of the SOA concepts, was built by the customer\nwith the participation of Atos Origin, a leading international IT\nservices provider. The existing customer IT infrastructure was\nalready built around UNIX systems, IBM System z, non-IBM clusters,\nSAP solutions, 3270 screens, IMS-DL/I databases, and specific code.\nSOA was the right solution to connect this existing environment to\nnew components using Java, Web services, and DB2 in particular.</p><p>This book explores the business needs and the architectural\nchoices that were faced by the customer. It describes the mock-ups\nand prototypes, provides performance numbers that were used to\nvalidate the decisions, and explains how they were implemented.

			"title": "Friction-Induced Vibrations and Self-Organization",
			"description": "<span><p>Many scientists and engineers do not realize that, under certain conditions, friction can lead to the formation of new structures at the interface, including <em>in situ</em> tribofilms and various patterns. In turn, these structures—usually formed by destabilization of the stationary sliding regime—can lead to the reduction of friction and wear. <strong>Friction-Induced Vibrations and Self-Organization: Mechanics and Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Sliding Contact </strong>combines the mechanical and thermodynamic methods in tribology, thus extending the field of mechanical friction-induced vibrations to non-mechanical instabilities and self-organization processes at the frictional interface. The book also relates friction-induced self-organization to novel biomimetic materials, such as self-lubricating, self-cleaning, and self-healing materials. </p><p><strong><em>Explore Friction from a Different Angle—as a Fundamental Force of Nature</em></strong></p><p>The book begins with an exploration of friction as a fundamental force of nature throughout the history of science. It then introduces general concepts related to vibrations, instabilities, and self-organization in the bulk of materials and at the interface. After presenting the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics as they apply to the interface, the book formulates the laws of friction and highlights important implications. The authors also analyze wear and lubrication. They then turn their attention to various types of friction-induced vibration, and practical situations and applications where these vibrations are important. The final chapters consider various types of friction-induced self-organization and how these effects can be used for novel self-lubricating, self-cleaning, and self-healing materials.</p><p><strong><em>From Frictional Instabilities to Friction-Induced Self-Organization</em></strong></p><p>Drawing on the authors’ original research, this book presents a new, twenty-first century perspective on friction and tribology. It shows how friction-induced instabilities and vibrations can lead to self-organized structures, and how understanding the structure–property relationships that lead to self-organization is key to designing \"smart\" biomimetic materials.</p></span>",

The IBM WebSphere Service-Oriented\nMiddleware product suite includes different integration brokers and\na multitude of application and technology adapters. In addition to\nthe adapter-based integration approach, this product suite supports\na wide range of open standards to connect any back-end component in\na service-like manner to the middleware infrastructure.</p><p>This book highlights broker-to-broker connectivity to the SAP\nExchange Infrastructure as well as direct communication patterns to\nthe SAP WebApplication Server. This book also illustrates how to\nintegrate data and processes that are located in SAP back-end\nsystems that use IBM Service-Oriented Middleware technology. The\nadapter-based scenarios use the WebSphere adapters for SAP, and the\nstandards-based integration scenarios use the Web Services and Java\nMessage Service capabilities that are built in to the products of\nboth IBM and SAP.</p><p>Please note that the additional material referenced in the text is not available from IBM.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><em>Building high-quality software is never simple, and it is always a good idea to reexamine the principles of good design and craftsmanship. In this book, you will find a fresh perspective that I hope you will enjoy as much as I did.</em> -- From the Foreword by Cay Horstmann, author of Big Java, Core Java, and many other titles</p><p>Serious developers know that code can always be improved. With each iteration, you make optimizations—small and large—that can have a huge impact on your application’s speed, size, resilience, and maintainability.</p><p>In <strong>Seriously Good Software: Code that Works, Survives, and Wins</strong>, author, teacher, and Java expert Marco Faella teaches you techniques for writing better code. You’ll start with a simple application and follow it through seven careful refactorings, each designed to explore another dimension of quality.</p><h3>about the technology</h3><p>Great code blends the skill of a programmer with the time-tested techniques and best practices embraced by the entire development community. Although each application has its own context and character, some dimensions of quality are always important. This book concentrates on seven pillars of seriously good software: speed, memory usage, reliability, readability, thread safety, generality, and elegance. The Java-based examples demonstrate techniques that apply to any OO language.</p><h3>about the book</h3><p><strong>Seriously Good Software</strong> is a handbook for any professional developer serious about improving application quality. It explores fundamental dimensions of code quality by enhancing a simple implementation into a robust, professional-quality application. Questions, exercises, and Java-based examples ensure you’ll get a firm grasp of the concepts as you go. When you finish the last version of the book’s central project, you’ll be able to confidently choose the right optimizations for your code.</p><h3>what's inside</h3><ul><li>Evaluating software qualities </li><li>Assessing trade-offs and interactions </li><li>Fulfilling different objectives in a single task </li><li>Java-based exercises you can apply in any OO language </li></ul><h3>about the audience</h3><p>For developers with basic object-oriented programming skills and intermediate Java skills.</p><h3>about the author</h3><p><strong>Marco Faella</strong> teaches advanced programming at a major Italian university. His published work includes peer-reviewed research articles, a Java certification manual, and a video course.</p><p><em>A practical guide to writing better software.</em> -- Juan J. Durillo, LRZ SuperMUC</p><p><em>Absolute must-have for every computer science student!</em> -- Michał Ambroziewicz, Netsprint</p><p><em>This book should be a must-read for every new developer in any company.</em> -- Flavio Diez, codecentric AG</p><p>NARRATED BY MARK THOMAS</p></span>",
