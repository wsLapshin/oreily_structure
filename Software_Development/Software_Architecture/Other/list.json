But, unreasonable deadlines and shortcuts make it very hard to create such an architecture.\n</p><p>Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture starts with a discussion about the conventional layered architecture style and its disadvantages. It also talks about the advantages of the domain-centric architecture styles of Robert C. Martin's Clean Architecture and Alistair Cockburn's Hexagonal Architecture. Then, the book dives into hands-on chapters that show you how to manifest a hexagonal architecture in actual code. You'll learn in detail about different mapping strategies between the layers of a hexagonal architecture and see how to assemble the architecture elements into an application. The later chapters demonstrate how to enforce architecture boundaries. You'll also learn what shortcuts produce what types of technical debt and how, sometimes, it is a good idea to willingly take on those debts.\n</p><p>After reading this book, you'll have all the knowledge you need to create applications using the hexagonal architecture style of web development.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Identify potential shortcomings of using a layered architecture\n</li><li>Apply methods to enforce architecture boundaries\n</li><li>Find out how potential shortcuts can affect the software architecture\n</li><li>Produce arguments for when to use which style of architecture\n</li><li>Structure your code according to the architecture\n</li><li>Apply various types of tests that will cover each element of the architecture</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for you if you care about the architecture of the software you are building. To get the most out of this book, you must have some experience with web development. The code examples in this book are in Java. If you are not a Java programmer but can read object-oriented code in other languages, you will be fine. In the few places where Java or framework specifics are needed, they are thoroughly explained.</p></span>",

Next, he shows how to flow an effective project design from the system design; how to accurately calculate the project duration, cost, and risk; and how to devise multiple execution options.</p><p>The method and principles in <em><strong>Righting Software</strong></em> apply regardless of your project and company size, technology, platform, or industry. Löwy starts the reader on a journey that addresses the critical challenges of software development today by righting software systems and projects as well as careers–and possibly the software industry as a whole. Software professionals, architects, project leads, or managers at any stage of their career will benefit greatly from this book, which provides guidance and knowledge that would otherwise take decades and many projects to acquire.</p><p><em>Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

By adhering to hexagonal principles, you can structure your software in a way that reduces the effort required to understand and maintain the code.</p><p>This book starts with an in-depth analysis of hexagonal architecture's building blocks, such as entities, use cases, ports, and adapters. You'll learn how to assemble business code in the Domain hexagon, create features by using ports and use cases in the Application hexagon, and make your software compatible with different technologies by employing adapters in the Framework hexagon. Moving on, you'll get your hands dirty developing a system based on a real-world scenario applying all the hexagonal architecture's building blocks. By creating a hexagonal system, you'll also understand how you can use Java modules to reinforce dependency inversion and ensure the isolation of each hexagon in the architecture. Finally, you'll get to grips with using Quarkus to turn your hexagonal application into a cloud-native system.</p><p>By the end of this hexagonal architecture book, you'll be able to bring order and sanity to the development of complex and long-lasting applications.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Find out how to assemble business rules algorithms using the specification design pattern</li><li>Combine domain-driven design techniques with hexagonal principles to create powerful domain models</li><li>Employ adapters to make the system support different protocols such as REST, gRPC, and WebSocket</li><li>Create a module and package structure based on hexagonal principles</li><li>Use Java modules to enforce dependency inversion and ensure isolation between software components</li><li>Implement Quarkus DI to manage the life cycle of input and output ports</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for software architects and Java developers who want to improve code maintainability and enhance productivity with an architecture that allows changes in technology without compromising business logic, which is precisely what hexagonal architecture does. Intermediate knowledge of the Java programming language and familiarity with Jakarta EE will help you to get the most out of this book.</p></span>",

Drawing on their\nextensive experience, the authors first help you decide what\ninformation to document, and then, with guidelines and examples (in\nvarious notations, including UML), show you how to express an\narchitecture so that others can successfully build, use, and\nmaintain a system from it. The book features rules for sound\ndocumentation, the goals and strategies of documentation,\narchitectural views and styles, documentation for software\ninterfaces and software behavior, and templates for capturing and\norganizing information to generate a coherent package. New and\nimproved in this second edition:</p><li><p>Coverage of architectural styles such as service-oriented\narchitectures, multi-tier architectures, and data models</p></li><li><p>Guidance for documentation in an Agile development\nenvironment</p></li><li><p>Deeper treatment of documentation of rationale, reflecting best\nindustrial practices</p></li><li><p>Improved templates, reflecting years of use and feedback, and\nmore documentation layout options</p></li><li><p>A new, comprehensive example (available online), featuring\ndocumentation of a Web-based service-oriented system</p></li><li><p>Reference guides for three important architecture documentation\nlanguages: UML, AADL, and SySML</p></li></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>Pattern - Oriented Software Architecture A System of Patterns Frank Buschmann, Regine Meunier, Hans Rohnert, Peter Sommerlad, Michael Stal of Siemens AG, Germany Pattern-oriented software architecture is a new approach to software development. This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.

			"description": "<span><p>Graduate to the next level of your software development career, learning the tools you need to successfully manage the complexity of modern software systems.</p><p>Whether you are a developer at a small software company, or one of many developers at a large enterprise, your success directly correlates to the ability of your development team to rapidly respond to change. What makes this task challenging in today’s world, is that the technical challenges we as developers strive to overcome are becoming increasingly more complex. We have to consider many more options when it comes to things like requirements, solution hosting, support, pace of change, and generally with less time and warning.</p><p>A good developer knows that it is critical to manage every aspect of software development from soup to nuts, and understands that when details and decisions are left to chance, outcomes can be negatively impacted. Poor planning can result in increased errors, substandard quality, budget and schedule overruns, and result in the ultimate business failure, dissatisfied customers, and stakeholders.</p><p>This book will help you put on the lenses of a software engineer. You will come away with an understanding of how to view the entire spectrum of the software development process, learn valuable concepts, and apply these principles through meaningful examples, case studies, and source code.</p><p> </p><p><br/></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Move beyond being a programmer to being a professional software engineer</li><li>Spend more time doing software development; minimize time spent dealing with ineffective or inadequate processes</li><li>Reduce errors in judgment and provide predictable outcomes, while still maintaining agility and responsiveness using Lean and Agile practices</li><li>Know the steps you can take to ensure a shared understanding among stakeholders</li><li>Discover tools to validate user experience early and often to minimize costly re-work</li><li>Develop software designs and architectures that enable long-term business agility</li><li>Implement patterns and processes that result in “falling into the pit of success” instead of into the “pit of failure”</li><li>Adopt processes and patterns that will result in pervasive “institutionalized” quality</li><li>Understand the necessity of redefining the essential role of technical leadership to ensure team maturity and growth</li></ul><p></p><p> </p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Software developers and team leaders who have struggled to implement design and development best practices due to lack of team resources, in-depth knowledge, or experience, and want a book designed to provide the confidence and foundational skills needed to achieve success</p></span>",

However, in this melee, many enterprises often neglect to invest in architects by presuming architecture is not an intrinsic element of Agile software development.</p><p>Since the role of an architect is not pre-defined in Agile, many organizations struggle to position architects, often resulting in friction with other roles or a failure to provide a clear learning path for architects to be productive.</p><p>This book guides architects and organizations through new Agile ways of incrementally developing the architecture for delivering an uninterrupted, continuous flow of values that meets customer needs. You'll explore various aspects of Agile architecture and how it differs from traditional architecture. The book later covers Agile architects' responsibilities and how architects can add significant value by positioning themselves appropriately in the Agile flow of work. Through examples, you'll also learn concepts such as architectural decision backlog,the last responsible moment, value delivery, architecting for change, DevOps, and evolutionary collaboration.</p><p>By the end of this Agile book, you'll be able to operate as an architect in Agile development initiatives and successfully architect reliable software systems.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Acquire clarity on the duties of architects in Agile development</li><li>Understand architectural styles such as domain-driven design and microservices</li><li>Identify the pitfalls of traditional architecture and learn how to develop solutions</li><li>Understand the principles of value and data-driven architecture</li><li>Discover DevOps and continuous delivery from an architect's perspective</li><li>Adopt Lean-Agile documentation and governance</li><li>Develop a set of personal and interpersonal qualities</li><li>Find out how to lead the transformation to achieve organization-wide agility</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This agile study guide is for architects currently working on agile development projects or aspiring to work on agile software delivery, irrespective of the methodology they are using. You will also find this book useful if you're a senior developer or a budding architect looking to understand an agile architect's role by embracing agile architecture strategies and a lean-agile mindset. To understand the concepts covered in this book easily, you need to have prior knowledge of basic agile development practices.</p></span>",

Now, pioneering IBM Distinguished Engineer and\nChief Technology Officer Tilak Mitra offers the first complete\nguide to developing end-to-end solution architectures that are\n“just enough”--identifying and capturing the most\nimportant artifacts, without over-engineering or excessive\ndocumentation, and providing a practical approach to consistent and\nrepeated success in defining software architectures.<br/>\n<br/>\n<em>Practical Software Architecture</em> provides detailed\nprescriptive and pragmatic guidance for architecting any real-world\nIT project, regardless of system, methodology, or environment.\nMitra specifically identifies the artifacts that require emphasis\nand shows how to communicate evolving solutions with stakeholders,\nbridging the gap between architecture and implementation.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough a real-world case study, Mitra guides you iteratively\nthrough building an end-to-end solution architecture. Step by step,\nhe addresses key topics in developing system contexts, architecture\noverviews, architecture decisions, functional models, operational\nmodels, integration patterns for systems design, infrastructure\nmatters, and more. Throughout, you’ll find clear, crisp, and\naccurate guidance for crafting architectures that can be\nconfidently delivered on time and budget.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Coverage Includes</b><br/></p><li><p>Using architecture to promote communication, enable planning,\nand support functional as well as nonfunctional capabilities (such\nas scalability, performance, maintainability, and security)</p></li><li><p>Focusing on the architectural problem at hand and avoiding\noverreliance on theory and generalization</p></li><li><p>An architectural introduction to analytics</p></li><li><p>Capturing “just enough” about system context,\narchitecture overview, architecture decisions, functional models,\nand operational models</p></li><li><p>Integration patterns and their usage in architecture\ndesign</p></li><li><p>Infrastructure matters in any software architecture</p></li><li><p>A real-world case study and its software architecture</p></li></span></span>",

Modern software has become complex and adaptable due to the emergence of globalization and new software technologies, devices and networks. These changes challenge both traditional software quality assurance techniques and software engineers to ensure software quality when building today (and tomorrow’s) adaptive, context-sensitive, and highly diverse applications. </p><p>This edited volume presents state of the art techniques, methodologies, tools, best practices and guidelines for software quality assurance and offers guidance for future software engineering research and practice. Each contributed chapter considers the practical application of the topic through case studies, experiments, empirical validation, or systematic comparisons with other approaches already in practice. Topics of interest include, but are not limited, to: quality attributes of system/software architectures; aligning enterprise, system, and software architecture from the point of view of total quality; design decisions and their influence on the quality of system/software architecture; methods and processes for evaluating architecture quality; quality assessment of legacy systems and third party applications; lessons learned and empirical validation of theories and frameworks on architectural quality; empirical validation and testing for assessing architecture quality.</p><ul><li>Focused on quality assurance at all levels of software design and development</li><li>Covers domain-specific software quality assurance issues e.g. for cloud, mobile, security, context-sensitive, mash-up and autonomic systems</li><li>Explains likely trade-offs from design decisions in the context of complex software system engineering and quality assurance</li><li>Includes practical case studies of software quality assurance for complex, adaptive and context-critical systems</li></ul></span>",

Written by experienced use case\npractitioners, this book fills a critical information gap by\npresenting a pattern language that contains over thirty patterns,\nproviding simple, elegant, and proven solutions to the most common\nproblems in use case development. These patterns distill and define\nthe properties and characteristics of quality use cases. As such,\nthey facilitate the development of original use cases and provide a\ndiagnostic tool for evaluating existing ones.</p><p>The book opens with a review of use cases and pattern\nfundamentals, along with a discussion of the requirements-gathering\nteam. These patterns address the use case development process, the\ninternal structure of use cases, and the relationships among use\ncases within the system as a whole. Examples of patterns\ninclude:</p><ul><li><p>BreadthBeforeDepth</p></li><li><p>VisibleBoundary</p></li><li><p>EverUnfoldingStory</p></li><li><p>IntentionRevealingName</p></li><li><p>PreciseAndReadable</p></li><li><p>LeveledSteps</p></li><li><p>InterruptsAsExtensions</p></li><li><p>RedistributeTheWealth</p></li></ul><p>Each pattern discussion includes at least one example\ndemonstrating its real-world application, highlighting both the\nbenefits of using the pattern and the consequences of not doing so.\nIn addition, the book presents guidelines for the effective use of\nUML with relevant patterns.</p><p>Anyone involved in use case writing or requirements gathering\nwill find <b><em>Patterns for Effective Use Cases</em></b> an\nindispensable handbook and reference.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201721848B07302002</p></span>",

			"description": "<span>Master how to implement a repeatable software construction system. This book closely examines how a system is designed to tie a series of activities together that are needed when building software-intensive systems. <div><br/></div><div>Software construction and operations don't get enough attention as a repeatable system. The world is stuck in agile backlog grooming sessions, and quality is not increasing. Companies' budgets are shrinking, and teams need a way to get more done with less, consistently. This topic is very relevant to our current economic conditions and continuing globalization trends. A reason we constantly need more hands-on-the-keyboards is because of all the waste created in development cycles. We need more literature on how to \"do software\" not just write software.  </div><div><br/></div><div>These goals are accomplished using the concept of evolutions, much like the Navy SEALS train their team members.  For LIFT, the evolutions are: Plan, Build, Test, Release, Operate and Manage.  The entire purpose of the book is instructing professionals how to use these distinct evolutions while remaining agile. And then, inside of each evolution, to explicitly break down the inputs to the evolution, outputs and series of activities taking place.<i> Patterns of Software Constructio</i>n clearly outlines how together this becomes the system.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li>Optimize each evolution of a software delivery cycle</li><li>Review best practices of planning, highest return in the build cycle, and ignored practices in test, release, and operate </li><li>Apply the highest return techniques during the software build evolution</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Managers, developers, tech lead, team lead, aspiring engineer, department leaders in corporations, executives, small business owner, IT Director<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div><div><br/></div></span>",

In response, more than thirty leading\nindustrial organizations have joined SAE (formerly, the Society of\nAutomotive Engineers) to define the SAE Architecture Analysis &amp;\nDesign Language (AADL) AS-5506 Standard, a rigorous and extensible\nfoundation for model-based engineering analysis practices that\nencompass software system design, integration, and assurance. Using\nAADL, you can conduct lightweight and rigorous analyses of critical\nreal-time factors such as performance, dependability, security, and\ndata integrity. You can integrate additional established and custom\nanalysis/specification techniques into your engineering\nenvironment, developing a fully unified architecture model that\nmakes it easier to build reliable systems that meet customer\nexpectations.</p><p><b><em>Model-Based Engineering with\nAADL</em></b> is the first guide to using this new international\nstandard to optimize your development processes. Coauthored by\nPeter H. Feiler, the standard’s author and technical lead,\nthis introductory reference and tutorial is ideal for self-directed\nlearning or classroom instruction, and is an excellent reference\nfor practitioners, including architects, developers, integrators,\nvalidators, certifiers, first-level technical leaders, and project\nmanagers. Packed with real-world examples, it introduces all\naspects of the AADL notation as part of an architecture-centric,\nmodel-based engineering approach to discovering embedded software\nsystems problems earlier, when they cost less to solve. Throughout,\nthe authors compare AADL to other modeling notations and\napproaches, while presenting the language via a complete case\nstudy: the development and analysis of a realistic example system\nthrough repeated refinement and analysis.</p><p><b>Part One</b> introduces both the AADL\nlanguage and core Model-Based Engineering (MBE) practices,\nexplaining basic software systems modeling and analysis in the\ncontext of an example system, and offering practical guidelines for\neffectively applying AADL.</p><p><b>Part Two</b> describes the\ncharacteristics of each AADL element, including their\nrepresentations, applicability, and constraints.</p><p>The Appendix includes comprehensive listings\nof AADL language elements, properties incorporated in the AADL\nstandard, and a description of the book’s example system.</p></span>",

Constantine</b>--who originally\ncreated structured design to effect such improvement--now joins\nwith well-known consultant <b>Lucy A. D.

			"description": "<span><span><p>Learn proven, real-world techniques for specifying software\nrequirements with this practical reference. It details 30\nrequirement “patterns” offering realistic examples for\nsituation-specific guidance for building effective software\nrequirements. Each pattern explains what a requirement needs to\nconvey, offers potential questions to ask, points out potential\npitfalls, suggests extra requirements, and other advice. This book\nalso provides guidance on how to write other kinds of information\nthat belong in a requirements specification, such as assumptions, a\nglossary, and document history and references, and how to structure\na requirements specification.</p><p>A disturbing proportion of computer systems are judged to be\ninadequate; many are not even delivered; more are late or over\nbudget. Studies consistently show one of the single biggest causes\nis poorly defined requirements: not properly defining what a system\nis for and what it’s supposed to do. Even a modest\ncontribution to improving requirements offers the prospect of\nsaving businesses part of a large sum of wasted investment. This\nguide emphasizes this important requirement need—determining\nwhat a software system needs to do before spending time on\ndevelopment. Expertly written, this book details solutions that\nhave worked in the past, with guidance for modifying patterns to\nfit individual needs—giving developers the valuable advice\nthey need for building effective software requirements</p></span></span>",

He\npassionately believes that one hour spent with an end user is worth\nmany hours making software architectural choices or days\ndocumenting perceived user requirements. Most of what is written\nabout software development focuses on methods used to design and\ndevelop robust software. Luke’s latest effort, <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture</em>, illuminates the more mundane aspects of\ncreating true business solutions by supporting the user throughout\nthe lifecycle of the software product. By concerning himself with\ncreating business value, Luke tightens the connection between a\nsoftware application and the business function it\nperforms.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Bruce\nBourbon</b><br/>\n             General\nPartner, Telos Venture Partners</p><p>“There are two kinds of people that read the Dilbert comic\nstrip: folks that take a moment to marvel at how accurately it\nreflects life at their company before moving on to the next comic\nstrip, and folks that think Dilbert is an amusing reminder that\nhigh tech companies can and should be better than Dilbert’s\nworld. Anyone in the first group should stick to reading comics.\nThis book is for people in the latter group.”</p><p>\n         —<b>Tony\nNavarrete</b><br/>\n             Vice\nPresident, Diamondhead Ventures</p><p>“Luke brings a proven methodology to the challenge of\nsoftware development. In <em>Beyond Software Architecture</em>, Luke\nprovides practical and proven techniques that all development\nexecutives can employ to improve the productivity of their software\norganization.”</p><p>\n         —<b>G.\nBradford Solso</b><br/>\n             CEO,\nTaviz Technology</p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em> is the first book I\nhave read which contains an insider’s perspective of both the\nbusiness and technical facets of software architecture. This is a\ngreat book to get marketers and software managers on the same\npage!”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Damon\nSchechter</b><br/>\n             CEO,\nLOC Global<br/>\n             author\nof <em>Delivering the Goods</em></p><p>“There are books on technical architecture and books on\nproduct marketing, but few, if any, on how architecture and\nmarketing information must be integrated for world class product\ndevelopment. <em>Beyond Software Architecture</em> provides this\nvaluable bridge between technology and marketing&amp;#8212it\nexplains how to deliver quality products that are profitable in the\nmarketplace.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Jim\nHighsmith</b><br/>\n             Director,\nCutter Consortium<br/>\n             author\nof <em>Adaptive Software Development</em></p><p>“Product development managers, marketing managers,\narchitects, and technical leads from all functions should read this\nbook. You’ll see a pragmatic view of how to define and use a\nproduct architecture throughout a project’s lifecycle and a\nproduct's lifetime.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Johanna\nRothman</b><br/>\n             Rothman\nConsulting Group, Inc.</p><p>“Luke Hohmann has captured the essence of product creation\nin his latest book.

Technical architectures have profound business ramifications,\nand ignoring the business ramifications of portability, usability,\nconfiguration, upgrade and release management, security, and other\narchitectural choices can not only lead to project failures, but\nultimately to nasty lawsuits from disappointed customers. <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture</em> is a must-read for successful software\nproduct managers!”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Ed\nYourdon</b><br/>\n             Author\nof numerous books and articles on software development</p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em> is not just for\nsoftware engineering professionals! Executives and product managers\nwill find that the book provides the necessary background to make\ninformed decisions about the software that their companies build. I\nhave found that the book is a useful tool for building consensus\nbetween management and engineering, because it discusses business\nand customer-related issues without delving too deeply into\nimplementation details.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>David\nChaiken</b><br/>\n             Vice\nPresident, Systems Architecture<br/>\n             AgileTV\nCorporation</p><p>“Product marketing influences product architecture. This\nshouldn’t be a surprise, yet most texts on software\narchitecture are silent on this fact. This may be because we lack\nthe language for distinguishing between the technical aspects of an\narchitecture and the marketing aspects. <em>Beyond Software\nArchitecture</em> provides the language to draw this important\ndistinction, and provides strategies for overall architectural\nsuccess.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Dave\nW. Smith</b></p><p>“<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em>, as the title\nimplies, successfully addresses the often neglected aspects of\ndeveloping total solutions. Hohmann demonstrates both passion and\ndepth for the broad set of topics discussed.”</p><p>\n         &amp;#8212<b>Craig\nPriess</b><br/>\n             Director\nProduct Management, Resonant Software</p><p>“Looking through my technical library, it’s apparent\nthat many books are obsolete, casualties of technical innovation\nand change. There are a few, however, that remain and continue to\nbe relevant. Adding Luke Hohmann’s new book, <em>Beyond\nSoftware Architecture: Creating and Sustaining Winning\nSolutions</em> expands that selection and fills an important gap.

But adopting open source practices without understanding the cultural context behind them often fails. That’s where this report comes in.</p><p>Author Silona Bonewald explains how the InnerSource initiative, introduced by PayPal, can help your company develop software internally by applying lessons from the open source movement. A checklist guides you through various steps needed to produce open source software, whether it’s companywide or just for one team.</p><p>Alongside the <i>how</i>, Bonewald—Director of InnerSource Commons—also explains the <i>why</i> behind open source. You’ll learn ways to improve collaboration, create cleaner code, reduce bottlenecks, and facilitate integrations among teams.</p><p>This report examines:</p><ul><li>Ways to adapt InnerSource to your business environment without diluting open source fundamentals</li><li>The crucial role of the Trusted Committer in the InnerSource process</li><li>How to extracting tribal knowledge from silos through <i>passive documentation</i></li><li>Why <i>contributing agreements</i> formalize the responsibilities of developers who originate code</li><li>How to move from internal silos to internal transparency</li></ul></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>For software to consistently deliver promised results, software\ndevelopment must mature into a true profession. <em>Emergent\nDesign</em> points the way. As software continues to evolve and\nmature, software development processes become more complicated,\nrelying on a variety of methodologies and approaches. This book\nilluminates the path to building the next generation of software.\nAuthor Scott L. Bain integrates the best of today’s most\nimportant development disciplines into a unified, streamlined,\nrealistic, and fully actionable approach to developing software.\nDrawing on patterns, refactoring, and test-driven development, Bain\noffers a blueprint for moving efficiently through the entire\nsoftware lifecycle, smoothly managing change, and consistently\ndelivering systems that are robust, reliable, and\ncost-effective.</p><p>Reflecting a deep understanding of the natural flow of system\ndevelopment, <em>Emergent Design</em> helps developers work with the\nflow, instead of against it. Bain introduces the principles and\npractices of emergent design one step at a time, showing how to\npromote the natural evolution of software systems over time, making\nsystems work better and provide greater value. To illuminate his\napproach, Bain presents code examples wherever necessary and\nconcludes with a complete project case study.</p><p>This book provides developers, project leads, and testers\npowerful new ways to collaborate, achieve immediate goals, and\nbuild systems that improve in quality with each iteration.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><li><p>How to design software in a more natural, evolutionary, and\nprofessional way</p></li><li><p>How to use the “open-closed” principle to mitigate\nrisks and eliminate waste</p></li><li><p>How and when to test your design throughout the development\nprocess</p></li><li><p>How to translate design principles into practices that actually\nlead to better code</p></li><li><p>How to determine how much design is enough</p></li><li><p>How refactoring can help you reduce over-design and manage\nchange more effectively</p></li><p>The book’s companion Web site, www.netobjectives.com/resources,\nprovides updates, links to related materials, and support for\ndiscussions of the book’s content.</p></span></span>",

The\nauthors have used their wealth of experience to produce an\nexcellent and insightful collection of detailed examples,\nexplanations, and advice on how to work with use cases.\"</em></p><p>–Maria Ericsson</p><p>The toughest challenge in building a software system that meets\nthe needs of your audience lies in clearly understanding the\nproblems that the system must solve. <em>Advanced Use Case\nModeling</em> presents a framework for discovering, identifying, and\nmodeling the problem that the software system will ultimately\nsolve.</p><p>Software developers often employ use cases to specify what\nshould be performed by the system they're constructing. Although\nuse case-driven analysis, design, and testing of software systems\nhas become increasingly popular, little has been written on the\nrole of use cases in the complete software cycle. This book fills\nthat need by describing how to create use case models for complex\nsoftware development projects, using practical examples to explain\nconceptual information.</p><p>The authors extend the work of software visionary Ivar Jacobson,\nusing the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the notation to\ndescribe the book's models. Aimed primarily at software\nprofessionals, <em>Advanced Use Case Modeling</em> also includes\ninformation that relates use case technique to business\nprocesses.</p><p>This book presents a process for creating and maintaining use\ncase models in a framework that can be fully customized for your\norganization. The authors, pioneers in the application of use cases\nin software development, bring their extensive experience to cover\ntopics such as:</p><li><p>A process model for applying a use case model</p></li><li><p>How to keep your use case modeling effort on track</p></li><li><p>Tips and pitfalls in use case modeling</p></li><li><p>How to organize your use case model for large-system\ndevelopment</p></li><li><p>Similarities between Advanced Use Case Modeling and the\nRational Unified Process framework</p></li><li><p>Effect of use cases on user interface design</p></li><li><p>Guidelines for quality use case modeling</p></li></span>",

Fortunately,\nproven tools and techniques exist for every facet of software\nestimation. Estimating Software-Intensive Systems brings them\ntogether in a real-world guidebook that will help software\nmanagers, engineers, and customers immediately improve their\nestimates—and drive continuing improvements over time.</p><p>Dick Stutzke presents here a disciplined and repeatable process\nthat can produce accurate and complete</p><p>estimates for any project, product, or process, no matter how\nnew or unusual. Stutzke doesn't just describe formal techniques: He\noffers simple, easy-to-use templates, spreadsheets, and tools you\ncan start using today to identify and estimate product size,\nperformance, and quality—as well as project cost, schedule,\nand risk reserves.</p><p>Stutzke shows how to quickly \"get your arms around\" users'\nproblems and requirements, the structure of a solution, and the\nprocess needed to deliver it. You'll learn how to choose the most\nappropriate estimating techniques and tools; collect accurate data,\ntrack progress, and update estimates; and recalibrate estimating\nmodels to improve estimation accuracy.</p><p>Stutzke's techniques apply whether you're creating custom\nin-house business software, purchasing or customizing\n\"off-the-shelf\" technology, or constructing complex, one-of-a-kind\nmilitary, industrial, or commercial systems. These techniques apply\nto small and large projects, and to all project life\ncycles—from agile to plan-driven. This book will help you\nplan, estimate, budget, schedule, purchase, design, build, test,\ndeploy, operate, and maintain software-intensive systems. It\nexplains how to size software, identify all cost components,\ncalculate the associated costs, and set a competitive price.</p><p>A separate section covers topics of interest for large projects:\ndesigning an appropriate work breakdown structure, collecting data\nfrom cost accounting systems, and using earned value\nmeasurement.</p><p>An accompanying CD-ROM contains templates, supplemental notes,\nand Microsoft Excel spreadsheets to estimate and track projects,\nproduct characteristics, and processes. It contains an extensive\nbibliography and links to web resources on software estimation,\nmeasurement, and related topics.

And yet, long-term observations in the field by the Software Improvement Group (SIG) reveals that many organizations don’t have the necessary resources or institutional processes to make it happen.</p><p>In this report, you’ll learn how 1,442 software developers responded to a 2016 survey on code quality conducted by SIG in collaboration with O’Reilly. The results reinforce previous findings that, although code quality is valued in principle, software development organizations often measure and manage it unevenly—or not at all—in their day-to-day practices.</p><p>This report provides a detailed assessment of responses to survey questions about working environments, accountability for code quality, and the use of code quality processes and tools. Major findings reveal that:</p><ul><li>A large majority of respondents believe that accountability for code quality rests with individual developers and their teams</li><li>Most developers don’t use tools for improving software quality, largely because they lack the budget to acquire them</li><li>Many developers can’t rely on common code quality tools because those tools don’t support the technologies and languages they use</li><li>Other developers are simply unaware of available tools, or are working with teams that have never used them</li></ul><p>How does your organization and development team stack up against these survey results? Compare your coding habits to the questions in this report and learn about your own code quality efforts and capabilities.</p></div></span>",

In this report, author Konrad Malawski analyzes reactive principles, and explains how and when it makes sense to adopt this relatively new programming paradigm for systems design.</p><p>Many ideas behind the reactive paradigm aren’t new, such as the actor-based programming model, but with recent trends in cloud computing, mobile app development, and the rise of the IoT sector, reactive is taking off in mainstream enterprise software development. This report takes you on a deep dive into the technical aspects of reactive and explores areas where this architecture can be a good fit for your organization.</p><p>You’ll explore:</p><ul><li><b>Reactive on the application level:</b> apply reactive principles within a single application, and understand its impact on resource utilization</li><li><b>Reactive on the system level:</b> examine the architectural and organizational impact of distributed reactive applications</li><li><b>Building blocks of reactive systems:</b> learn about several tools that will facilitate your move toward reactive programming</li></ul></div></span>",

Economics-driven software development can increase quality, productivity, and profitability, but comprehensive knowledge is needed to understand the architectural challenges involved in dealing with the development of large, architecturally challenging systems in an economic way.</p><p>This book covers how to apply economic considerations during the software architecting activities of a project. Architecture-centric approaches to development and systematic evolution, where managing complexity, cost reduction, risk mitigation, evolvability, strategic planning and long-term value creation are among the major drivers for adopting such approaches. It assists the objective assessment of the lifetime costs and benefits of evolving systems, and the identification of legacy situations, where architecture or a component is indispensable but can no longer be evolved to meet changing needs at economic cost. Such consideration will form the scientific foundation for reasoning about the economics of nonfunctional requirements in the context of architectures and architecting.</p><ul><li>Familiarizes readers with essential considerations in economic-informed and value-driven software design and analysis </li><li>Introduces techniques for making value-based software architecting decisions</li><li>Provides readers a better understanding of the methods of economics-driven architecting</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The book describes a fundamentally new approach to software dependability, considering a software system as an ever-changing system due to changes in service objectives, users’ requirements, standards and regulations, and to advances in technology. Such a system is viewed as an Open System since its functions, structures, and boundaries are constantly changing. Thus, the approach to dependability is called Open Systems Dependability. The DEOS technology realizes Open Systems Dependability. It puts more emphasis on stakeholders’ agreement and accountability achievement for business/service continuity than in elemental technologies. </p></span>",

With a structured but hands-on approach, the book: </p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Delineates malleable and stable characteristics of software design</li><li>Explains how to evaluate the short- and long-term costs and benefits of design decisions</li><li>Compares and contrasts design solutions, such as composition versus inheritance</li><li>Includes supportive appendices and a glossary of over 200 common terms</li><li>Covers key topics such as polymorphism, overloading, and more</li><p/></ul><p>While extensive examples are given in C# and/or C++, often demonstrating alternative solutions, design—not syntax—remains the focal point of <b>Software Essentials: Design and Construction</b>. </p><p><strong>About the Cover: </strong></p><p>Although capacity may be a problem for a doghouse, other requirements are usually minimal. Unlike skyscrapers, doghouses are simple units. They do not require plumbing, electricity, fire alarms, elevators, or ventilation systems, and they do not need to be built to code or pass inspections. </p><p>The range of complexity in software design is similar. Given available software tools and libraries—many of which are free—hobbyists can build small or short-lived computer apps. Yet, design for software longevity, security, and efficiency can be intricate—as is the design of large-scale systems. How can a software developer prepare to manage such complexity? By understanding the essential building blocks of software design and construction.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p><i>There is today a pronounced and accelerated convergence in architecture. This convergence is occurring by doers not thinkers; in practice not academia; in building design, fabrication, and construction. It is about solution-centric individuals engaged in real time problem solving, not in abstractions. The nature of this convergence, where things are converging and what that means for architecture, is the subject of this book. –</i> from the Introduction<br/><br/></p><p>Those working in architecture and engineering feel pressure to work faster, at lower cost, while maintaining a high level of innovation and quality. At the same time, emergent tools and processes make this possible. <i>Convergence</i> is about the firms, teams and people who thrive in this environment as a result of their ability to creatively combine and innovate. It seeks to answer several timely questions: What are the tools and work processes that are converging? How are individuals and organizations converging their tools and work processes? What challenges and benefits are they seeing? What is the ultimate endgame of this convergence? What skillsets and mindsets would someone need to develop to work effectively in this changing environment? What are the implications of convergence on the role of the designer, and on design? On how we design, build, fabricate, and construct? On how we <i>work</i>?</p><p>The book explains how convergence relates to, but ultimately differs from integration, consolidation, multi-tasking, automation, and other forms of optimization. The practice-based research builds upon the author’s research in BIM and in the collaborative leveraging of data in design and fabrication. As an investigation and meditation on the impact of technology on the education and making of design professionals <i>Convergence</i> explains what is happening in the world of design, and discusses the implications for the future of education, training and practice.</p><p> </p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><span><p>The aim of the UML profile for framework architectures is the\ndefinition of a UML subset, enriched with a few UML-compliant\nextensions, which allows the annotation of such artefacts. Thus,\nthe resulting profile that we call UML-F does not correspond to a\nspecific domain, but to framework technology. Though profiles might\nbe standardized in the future, sound proposals from various\ncommunities will get the process of defining and standardizing UML\nprofiles started. In that sense, this book sets the stage for the\nUML profile for framework architectures.</p></span></span></span></span>",

			"title": "Designing Complex Systems",
			"description": "<span><p>Without standardized construction elements such as nuts, bolts, bearings, beams, resistors and the like, the design of physical equipment is hopelessly inefficient, and engineers are continually bogged down with re-designing these elements over and over again. Emphasizing a top-down approach, this volume considers the purpose and basic features of design and how the concept of value can provide a quantitative measure of that wider interaction of the engineered object with its environment. This work also develops the domain in which functional design takes place and explores how the system concept can be embedded in that domain. It proposes a number of functional design elements and develops them in considerable detail, outlining how they can be applied as part of a coherent design framework. For greater understanding of the discussed concepts, numerous examples and analogies are included.</p></span>",
