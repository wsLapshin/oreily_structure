Eric thinks that learning about your problem domain is as\nlikely to happen at the end of your project as at the beginning,\nand so refactoring is a big part of his technique.</p><p>“The book is a fun read. Eric has lots\nof interesting stories, and he has a way with words. I see this\nbook as essential reading for software developers—it is a\nfuture classic.”</p><p>—<b>Ralph Johnson</b>, author of\n<em>Design Patterns</em></p><p>“If you don’t think you are\ngetting value from your investment in object-oriented programming,\nthis book will tell you what you’ve forgotten to do.</p><p>“Eric Evans convincingly argues for\nthe importance of domain modeling as the central focus of\ndevelopment and provides a solid framework and set of techniques\nfor accomplishing it. This is timeless wisdom, and will hold up\nlong after the methodologies du jour have gone out of\nfashion.”</p><p>—<b>Dave Collins</b>, author of\n<em>Designing Object-Oriented User Interfaces</em></p><p>“Eric weaves real-world experience\nmodeling—and building—business applications into a\npractical, useful book. Written from the perspective of a trusted\npractitioner, Eric’s descriptions of ubiquitous language, the\nbenefits of sharing models with users, object life-cycle\nmanagement, logical and physical application structuring, and the\nprocess and results of deep refactoring are major contributions to\nour field.”</p><p>—<b>Luke Hohmann</b>, author of\n<em>Beyond Software Architecture</em></p><p>“This book belongs on the shelf of\nevery thoughtful software developer.”</p><p>—<b>Kent Beck</b></p><p>“What Eric has managed to capture is a\npart of the design process that experienced object designers have\nalways used, but that we have been singularly unsuccessful as a\ngroup in conveying to the rest of the industry. We've given away\nbits and pieces of this knowledge...but we've never organized and\nsystematized the principles of building domain logic. This book is\nimportant.”</p><p>—<b>Kyle Brown</b>, author of\n<em>Enterprise Java™ Programming with IBM<sup>®</sup>\nWebSphere<sup>®</sup></em></p><p>The software development community widely\nacknowledges that domain modeling is central to software design.\nThrough domain models, software developers are able to express rich\nfunctionality and translate it into a software implementation that\ntruly serves the needs of its users. But despite its obvious\nimportance, there are few practical resources that explain how to\nincorporate effective domain modeling into the software development\nprocess.</p><p><b><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></b> fills\nthat need. This is not a book about specific technologies. It\noffers readers a systematic approach to domain-driven design,\npresenting an extensive set of design best practices,\nexperience-based techniques, and fundamental principles that\nfacilitate the development of software projects facing complex\ndomains. Intertwining design and development practice, this book\nincorporates numerous examples based on actual projects to\nillustrate the application of domain-driven design to real-world\nsoftware development.</p><p>Readers learn how to use a domain model to\nmake a complex development effort more focused and dynamic. A core\nof best practices and standard patterns provides a common language\nfor the development team. A shift in emphasis—refactoring not\njust the code but the model underlying the code—in\ncombination with the frequent iterations of Agile development leads\nto deeper insight into domains and enhanced communication between\ndomain expert and programmer. <b><em>Domain-Driven Design</em></b>\nthen builds on this foundation, and addresses modeling and design\nfor complex systems and larger organizations.Specific topics\ncovered include:</p><li><p>Getting all team members to speak the same language</p></li><li><p>Connecting model and implementation more deeply</p></li><li><p>Sharpening key distinctions in a model</p></li><li><p>Managing the lifecycle of a domain object</p></li><li><p>Writing domain code that is safe to combine in elaborate\nways</p></li><li><p>Making complex code obvious and predictable</p></li><li><p>Formulating a domain vision statement</p></li><li><p>Distilling the core of a complex domain</p></li><li><p>Digging out implicit concepts needed in the model</p></li><li><p>Applying analysis patterns</p></li><li><p>Relating design patterns to the model</p></li><li><p>Maintaining model integrity in a large system</p></li><li><p>Dealing with coexisting models on the same project</p></li><li><p>Organizing systems with large-scale structures</p></li><li><p>Recognizing and responding to modeling breakthroughs</p></li><p>With this book in hand, object-oriented\ndevelopers, system analysts, and designers will have the guidance\nthey need to organize and focus their work, create rich and useful\ndomain models, and leverage those models into quality, long-lasting\nsoftware implementations.</p></span></span>",

Many Python developers are taking an interest in high-level software design patterns such as hexagonal/clean architecture, event-driven architecture, and the strategic patterns prescribed by domain-driven design (DDD). But translating those patterns into Python isn’t always straightforward.<br/><br/>With this hands-on guide, Harry Percival and Bob Gregory from MADE.com introduce proven architectural design patterns to help Python developers manage application complexity—and get the most value out of their test suites. <br/><br/>Each pattern is illustrated with concrete examples in beautiful, idiomatic Python, avoiding some of the verbosity of Java and C# syntax. Patterns include:</p><ul><li>Dependency inversion and its links to ports and adapters (hexagonal/clean architecture)</li><li>Domain-driven design’s distinction between Entities, Value Objects, and Aggregates </li><li>Repository and Unit of Work patterns for persistent storage</li><li>Events, commands, and the message bus</li><li>Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)</li><li>Event-driven architecture and reactive microservices</li></ul></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>You want increased customer satisfaction, faster development cycles, and less wasted work. Domain-driven design (DDD) combined with functional programming is the innovative combo that will get you there. In this pragmatic, down-to-earth guide, you'll see how applying the core principles of functional programming can result in software designs that model real-world requirements both elegantly and concisely - often more so than an object-oriented approach. Practical examples in the open-source F# functional language, and examples from familiar business domains, show you how to apply these techniques to build software that is business-focused, flexible, and high quality.</p><p>Domain-driven design is a well-established approach to designing software that ensures that domain experts and developers work together effectively to create high-quality software. This book is the first to combine DDD with techniques from statically typed functional programming. This book is perfect for newcomers to DDD or functional programming - all the techniques you need will be introduced and explained.</p><p>Model a complex domain accurately using the F# type system, creating compilable code that is also readable documentation---ensuring that the code and design never get out of sync. Encode business rules in the design so that you have \"compile-time unit tests,\" and eliminate many potential bugs by making illegal states unrepresentable. Assemble a series of small, testable functions into a complete use case, and compose these individual scenarios into a large-scale design. Discover why the combination of functional programming and DDD leads naturally to service-oriented and hexagonal architectures. Finally, create a functional domain model that works with traditional databases, NoSQL, and event stores, and safely expose your domain via a website or API.</p><p>Solve real problems by focusing on real-world requirements for your software.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The code in this book is designed to be run interactively on Windows, Mac and Linux.You will need a recent version of F# (4.0 or greater), and the appropriate .NET runtime for your platform.Full installation instructions for all platforms at fsharp.org.</p></div></span>",

In this book you will see how these all come together in one of the most efficient ways to develop complex software, with a particular focus on the DDD process.   </div><div><br/></div><div><i>Practical Domain-Driven Design in Enterprise Java </i>starts by building out the Cargo Tracker reference application as a monolithic application using the Jakarta EE platform. By doing so, you will map concepts of DDD (bounded contexts, language, and aggregates) to the corresponding available tools (CDI, JAX-RS, and JPA) within the Jakarta EE platform. </div><br/><div>Once you have completed the monolithic application, you will walk through the complete conversion of the monolith to a microservices-based architecture, again mapping the concepts of DDD and the corresponding available tools within the MicroProfile platform (config, discovery, and fault tolerance). To finish this section, you will examine the same microservices architecture on the Spring Boot platform. </div><div><br/></div><div>The final set of chapters looks at what the application would be like if you used the CQRS and event sourcing patterns.

			"title": "Domain-Driven Laravel: Learn to Implement Domain-Driven Design Using Laravel",
			"description": "<span>Map concepts and ideas in domain-driven design (DDD) and transpose them into clean, testable, and quality code that is effective alongside the Laravel framework. This book teaches you how to implement the concepts and patterns present in DDD in the real world as a complete web application. With these tactics and concepts in place, you'll engage in a variety of example applications, built from the ground up, and taken directly from real-world domains. <p>Begin by reviewing foundational stepping stones (with small, manageable examples to show proof of concepts as well as illustrations to conceptualize the more complex topics) of both DDD and Laravel. Specifically, such topics as entities, value objects, developing an ubiquitous language, DTOs, and knowledge discovery. Next, you will dive into some more advanced topics of DDD and use these concepts as a guide to make customizations to the default Laravel installation, giving you an understanding of why these alterations are vital to the DDD and Laravel platform. Finally, you will cover the very powerful Eloquent ORM that comes stock with Laravel and understand how it can be utilized to represent entities, handle repositories, and support domain events. </p><p>Although there is a basic coverage chapter and a setup tutorial for Laravel (along with a high level intro about the components used within it), <i>Domain-Driven Laravel</i> is best suited to readers who have been at least exposed to the framework and have had the opportunity to tinker around with it.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Utilize a blazing-fast rapid development pipeline built from DDD building blocks and facilitated with Laravel<br/></li><li>Implement value objects, repositories, entities, anti-corruption layers and others using Laravel as a web framework</li><li>Apply enhanced techniques for quick prototyping of complex requirements and quality results using an iterative and focused approach </li><li>Create a base framework (Laravel) that can serve as a template to start off any project</li><li>Gain insight on which details are important to a project’s success and how to acquire the necessary knowledge </li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Ideal for for frontend/backend web developers, devops engineers, Laravel framework lovers and PHP developers hoping to learn more about either Domain Driven Design or the possibilities with the Laravel framework. Those with a working knowledge of plain PHP can also gain value from reading this book. </p></span>",

It brings together experts from the academic, military, and business worlds to explore project management in the context of complexity theory and organizations. These experts explore a systemic and organic approach to projects that widens the scope of a project manager’s role as well as the tools and capabilities required.<br/><br/>The book provides readers with an understanding of the roots of project management in complexity theory and the human sciences. It explores seven principles of complexity theory and applies them to project management; examining project needs and features in terms of success parameters, team and stakeholders’ perspectives, the project manager’s perspective, and the perspectives of theory and practice.</p><ul><li>Explores a new humanistic paradigm in thinking about projects and project management</li><li>Illustrates the culture and philosophy of projects from a range of perspectives</li><li>Outlines an interdisciplinary approach to Project Management that integrates scientific and humanistic disciplines</li><p/></ul><p/><p>The contributors examine cutting-edge organizational models from management research and military leadership and map them to project management. They integrate insights from various disciplines to introduce tools that are relatively unknown to project managers and leaders.
