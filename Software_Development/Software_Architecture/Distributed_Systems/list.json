			"description": "<span><p><b>Understand how to apply distributed tracing to microservices-based architectures</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>A thorough conceptual introduction to distributed tracing\n</li><li>An exploration of the most important open standards in the space\n</li><li>A how-to guide for code instrumentation and operating a tracing infrastructure</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>Mastering Distributed Tracing will equip you to operate and enhance your own tracing infrastructure. Through practical exercises and code examples, you will learn how end-to-end tracing can be used as a powerful application performance management and comprehension tool. \n</p><p>The rise of Internet-scale companies, like Google and Amazon, ushered in a new era of distributed systems operating on thousands of nodes across multiple data centers. Microservices increased that complexity, often exponentially. It is harder to debug these systems, track down failures, detect bottlenecks, or even simply understand what is going on. Distributed tracing focuses on solving these problems for complex distributed systems. Today, tracing standards have developed and we have much faster systems, making instrumentation less intrusive and data more valuable.\n</p><p>Yuri Shkuro, the creator of Jaeger, a popular open-source distributed tracing system, delivers end-to-end coverage of the field in Mastering Distributed Tracing. Review the history and theoretical foundations of tracing; solve the data gathering problem through code instrumentation, with open standards like OpenTracing, W3C Trace Context, and OpenCensus; and discuss the benefits and applications of a distributed tracing infrastructure for understanding, and profiling, complex systems.\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>How to get started with using a distributed tracing system\n</li><li>How to get the most value out of end-to-end tracing\n</li><li>Learn about open standards in the space\n</li><li>Learn about code instrumentation and operating a tracing infrastructure\n</li><li>Learn where distributed tracing fits into microservices as a core function</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Any developer interested in testing large systems will find this book very revealing and in places, surprising. Every microservice architect and developer should have an insight into distributed tracing, and the book will help them on their way. System administrators with some development skills will also benefit. No particular programming language skills are required, although an ability to read Java, while non-essential, will help with the core chapters.</p></span>",

You will understand the problems in existing designs, know how to make small modifications to correct those problems, and learn to apply the principles of immutable architecture to your tools.<br/></div><div><br/></div>Most software components focus on the state of objects. They store the current state of a row in a relational database. They track changes to state over time, making several basic assumptions: there is a single latest version of each object, the state of an object changes sequentially, and a system of record exists.<div><br/></div><div>This is a challenge when it comes to building distributed systems. Whether dealing with autonomous microservices or disconnected mobile apps, many of the problems we try to solve come down to synchronizing an ever-changing state between isolated components. Distributed systems would be a lot easier to build if objects could not change.</div><div><br/></div><div>After reading <b><i>The Art of Immutable Architecture</i></b>, you will come away with an understanding of the benefits of using immutable objects in your own distributed systems. You will learn a set of rules for identifying and exchanging immutable objects, and see a collection of useful theorems that emerges and ensures that the distributed systems we build are eventually consistent. Using patterns, you will find where the truth converges, see how changes are associative, rather than sequential, and come to feel comfortable understanding that there is no longer a single source of truth. Practical hands-on examples reinforce how to build software using the described patterns, techniques, and tools. By the end, you will possess the language and resources needed to analyze and construct distributed systems with confidence.<br/></div><div><br/></div> The assumptions of the past were sufficient for building single-user, single-computer systems.

			"title": "Introducing Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr): Simplifying Microservices Applications Development Through Proven and Reusable Patterns and Practices",
			"description": "<span><div>Use this book to learn the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr), a new event-driven runtime from Microsoft designed to help developers build microservices applications, using a palette of languages and frameworks that run everywhere: on-premises, in any cloud, and even on the edge.<br/><p></p><b></b><p>One of the most popular architectural patterns for implementing large, complex, distributed solutions is the microservices architectural style. Because solutions are composed of services based on various languages, frameworks, and platforms, the more complex and compartmentalized an application becomes, the more considerations a developer has to keep in mind. Much of the time this proves to be difficult.<br/></p><b><i>Introducing </i></b><b><i>Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)</i></b> is your guide to achieving more with less through patterns. Part I of the book is about understanding microservices and getting up and running with Dapr, either on your machine or in <i>any </i>Kubernetes cluster. From there you are guided through the concepts of Dapr, how it works, and what it can do for you. You will wrap up with various ways to debug Dapr applications using Visual Studio Code locally, inside a container or Kubernetes. In Part II you will jump into the reusable patterns and practices, the building blocks of Dapr. You will go from service invocation, publish and subscribe, state management, resource bindings, and the Actor model to secrets; each building block is covered in detail in its own dedicated chapter. You will learn what Dapr offers from a functional perspective and also how you can leverage the three pillars of observability (logs, metrics, and traces) in order to gain insight into your applications. In Part III you will explore advanced concepts, including using middleware pipelines, integrating Dapr into web frameworks such as ASP.NET Core, or the runtimes of Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions.<p></p>\n<p>The book features a multi-versed set of examples that cover not only the plain API of Dapr, but also the .NET SDK. Hence, most of the examples are in .NET 5, with a small number in JavaScript to exemplify the use of multiple languages.

But performance has been an issue for distributed systems like Hadoop, especially when the use cases of a single cluster become multi-tenant or multi-workload. The worst part? You may not even know you have a performance issue. <br/><br/>In this report, Chad Carson and Sean Suchter from Pepperdata describe the performance challenges of running multi-tenant distributed computing environments, especially within a Hadoop context. After examining pros and cons of current solutions for these problems, you’ll learn how to use real-time, intelligent software that tracks and dynamically adjusts each application’s usage of physical hardware. Get ahead of your Hadoop operations for faster, better decision-making and faster, better business returns.<br/><br/>With this report, you’ll explore:</p><ul><li>How Hadoop and other multi-tenant distributed systems work, and why performance matters</li><li>Business-visible symptoms of performance problems: late jobs, inconsistent runtimes, and underutilized hardware</li><li>Scheduling challenges in multi-tenant systems</li><li>Symptoms and solutions for CPU performance limitations</li><li>Physical and virtual limits of node memory—and what happens when you run out</li><li>Identifying and solving performance problems due to disk and network performance limits and other typical bottlenecks</li><li>Solutions for monitoring performance and accurately allocating cluster costs among users and business units</li></ul></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p></p><p>The age of the distributed team is upon us. Teams can now operate and collaborate from locations other than a central office, and events surrounding the 2020 COVID pandemic have thrown its practicality into sharp relief. Managing a team whose members are distributed across several locations requires a different mindset and will remain a must-have for all areas of business from this point forward.</p><p><i>Building and Managing High-Performance Distributed Teams</i> explains what the <i>distributed teams</i> concept means to the future of your company. Author Alberto S. Silveira Jr. leverages his industry knowledge to explore why the high-performance distributed team model is vital to the future of business, and explains how to build and maintain one through times of change. You will learn to differentiate between distributed teams, remote work, offshoring, and what each means in a modern context. Silveira also weaves in stories from his other life as a boater and sailor, using analogies and lessons gained from humankind’s thousands of years of maritime adventure to illustrate the value of well-managed teams, and to also convey the importance of life-work balance in today’s working world.</p><p>The book analyzes team management strategies from some of the great successes and failures in recent years so that you can learn from the experiences of others. <i>Building and Managing High-Performance Distributed Teams</i> is your definitive guide for building a dynamic distributed team, using collaboration technology to attract and engage the most important element of any business—your people.

Today, there is renewed interest and adoption of this technology for building distributed systems, especially as cloud concurrency challenges increase. As this report explains, the Actor model provides a relatively simple but powerful way to design and implement reactive applications that can distribute work across clusters of cores and servers.</p><p>Author Hugh McKee shows you how Actors behave and interact as humans do when it comes to communicating, and how these similar behavioral patterns provide basic intuition when designing reactive systems. Actors allow your teams to focus on an application’s business logic rather than on low-level protocols, accelerating time-to-market while keeping your infrastructure costs low.</p><p>Download this report and discover:</p><ul><li>Why actor-based systems are one of the foundational technologies for creating microservice architectures</li><li>How Actors delegate work by creating other Actors in a supervisor-to-worker relationship</li><li>How Actors manage requests and scale horizontally in large systems</li><li>The difference between traditional systems and actor-based systems</li><li>How an Actor system forms clusters when the flow of work exceeds a system’s capacity to process it</li><li>Why failure detection and failure recovery is an architectural feature of Actor systems</li><li>An example of using Actors to build an Internet of Things (IoT) application</li></ul><p>Hugh McKee is a solutions architect at Lightbend. Prior to this role he served as a software architect and engineer at HP, where he helped build the core frameworks and platform that support the organization’s internal application teams.

It begins by describing the role of switch/routers in a network, then moves on to the functional composition of a switch/router. A comparison of centralized versus distributed design of the architecture is also presented. The author discusses use of bus versus shared-memory for communication within a design, and also covers Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms and configuration tools.</p><p>Written in a simple style and language to allow readers to easily understand and appreciate the material presented, <i>Switch/Router Architectures: Shared-Bus and Shared-Memory Based Systems</i> discusses the design of multilayer switches—starting with the basic concepts and on to the basic architectures. It describes the evolution of multilayer switch designs and highlights the major performance issues affecting each design. It addresses the need to build faster multilayer switches and examines the architectural constraints imposed by the various multilayer switch designs. The book also discusses design issues including performance, implementation complexity, and scalability to higher speeds. This resource also:</p><ul><li>Summarizes principles of operation and explores the most common installed routers</li><li>Covers the design of example architectures (shared bus and memory based architectures), starting from early software based designs</li><li>Provides case studies to enhance reader comprehension</li></ul><p><i>Switch/Router Architectures: Shared-Bus and Shared-Memory Based Systems</i> is an excellent guide for advanced undergraduate and graduate level students, as well for engineers and researchers working in the field.</p></span>",

The author's intent is for readers to learn not only the proofs, but the heuristics that guide said proofs.</p><p><em>Introduction to Lattice Theory with Computer Science Applications:</em></p><li><p>Examines; posets, Dilworth's theorem, merging algorithms, lattices, lattice completion, morphisms, modular and distributive lattices, slicing, interval orders, tractable posets, lattice enumeration algorithms, and dimension theory</p></li><li><p>Provides end of chapter exercises to help readers retain newfound knowledge on each subject</p></li><li><p>Includes supplementary material at <code>www.ece.utexas.edu/~garg</code></p></li><p><em>Introduction to Lattice Theory with Computer Science Applications</em> is written for students of computer science, as well as practicing mathematicians.</p></span></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>Thoroughly revised and expanded to help readers systematically increase their knowledge and insight about Sigma-Delta Modulators</b></p><p>Sigma-Delta Modulators (SDMs) have become one of the best choices for the implementation of analog/digital interfaces of electronic systems integrated in CMOS technologies. Compared to other kinds of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), Σ∆Ms cover one of the widest conversion regions of the resolution-versus-bandwidth plane, being the most efficient solution to digitize signals in an increasingly number of applications, which span from high-resolution low-bandwidth digital audio, sensor interfaces, and instrumentation, to ultra-low power biomedical systems and medium-resolution broadband wireless communications.</p><p>Following the spirit of its first edition, <i>Sigma-Delta Converters: Practical Design Guide, 2nd Edition</i> takes a comprehensive look at SDMs, their diverse types of architectures, circuit techniques, analysis synthesis methods, and CAD tools, as well as their practical design considerations. It compiles and updates the current research reported on the topic, and explains the multiple trade-offs involved in the whole design flow of Sigma-Delta Modulators—from specifications to chip implementation and characterization. The book follows a <i>top-down </i>approach in order to provide readers with the necessary understanding about recent advances, trends, and challenges in state-of-the-art Σ∆Ms. It makes more emphasis on two key points, which were not treated so deeply in the first edition:</p><ul><li>It includes a more detailed explanation of Σ∆Ms implemented using Continuous-Time (CT) circuits, going from system-level synthesis to practical circuit limitations.</li><li>It provides more practical case studies and applications, as well as a deeper description of the synthesis methodologies and CAD tools employed in the design of Σ∆ converters.</li></ul><p><i>Sigma-Delta Converters: Practical Design Guide, 2nd Edition</i> serves as an excellent textbook for undergraduate and graduate students in electrical engineering as well as design engineers working on SD data-converters, who are looking for a uniform and self-contained reference in this hot topic. With this goal in mind, and based on the feedback received from readers, the contents have been revised and structured to make this new edition a unique monograph written in a didactical, pedagogical, and intuitive style. </p></span>",

The design principles presented are universal and apply to all middleware platforms, including CORBA and Web Services. The authors have created an open-source implementation of CORBA, called MICO, which is freely available on the web.

Author and\nindependent network design consultant Kevin Dooley outlines\n\"top-down network design\" for building a technological\ninfrastructure to fit your organization's requirements, a process\nfar more effective and cost-efficient than fitting the organization\nto the parameters of a shrink-wrapped proprietary solution. Dooley\nargues that the design of a network is largely independent of the\nproducts used. Whether you use a Cisco or Juniper router, the same\nsecurity issues and protocols apply. The questions he addresses in\nthis book are need-specific: Do I use a router or a switch? Should\nI route between switched areas or switch between routed areas?\n<em>Designing Large-Scale LANs</em> covers everything from security,\nbandwidth and scalability to network reliability, which includes\nbackup, redundancy, and points of failure. Specific technologies\nare analyzed in detail: network topologies, routing and switching\nstrategies, wireless, virtual LANs, firewalls and gateways,\nsecurity, Internet protocols, bandwidth, and multicast services.\nThe book also discusses proprietary technologies that are\nubiquitous, such as Cisco's IOS and Novell's IPX. This complete\nguide to top-down network design will help you choose the right\nnetwork solutions. If you're designing large scale networks and\nneed expert advice and guidance, look no further than <em>Designing\nLarge-Scale LANs</em>.\n</p></span></span></span>",

They’d like to capitalize on real-time data analysis, move beyond batch processing for time-critical insights, allow multiple users to share cluster resources, and provide predictable service levels. However, fundamental performance limitations of complex distributed systems such as Hadoop prevent much of this from happening.</p><p>In this report, Courtney Webster examines the root cause of these performance problems and explains why best practices for mitigating them—cluster tuning, provisioning, and even cluster isolation for mission critical jobs—don’t provide viable, scalable, or long-term solutions.</p><p>Organizations have been pushing Hadoop and other distributed systems to their performance breaking points as they seek to use clusters as shared resources across multiple business units and individual users. Once they hit this performance wall, companies will find it difficult to deliver on the big data promise at scale.</p><p>Read this report to find out what the implications are for your organization.</p></div></span>",

Drawing on the work of leading experts around the world, <strong>Distributed Data Fusion for Network-Centric Operations </strong>examines the state of the art of data fusion in a distributed sensing, communications, and computing environment.</p><p><strong><em>Get Insight into Designing and Implementing Data Fusion in a Distributed Network</em></strong></p><p>Addressing the entirety of information fusion, the contributors cover everything from signal and image processing, through estimation, to situation awareness. In particular, the work offers a timely look at the issues and solutions involving fusion within a distributed network enterprise. These include critical design problems, such as how to maintain a pedigree of agents or nodes that receive information, provide their contribution to the dataset, and pass to other network components. The book also tackles dynamic data sharing within a network-centric enterprise, distributed fusion effects on state estimation, graph-theoretic methods to optimize fusion performance, human engineering factors, and computer ontologies for higher levels of situation assessment.</p><p>A comprehensive introduction to this emerging field and its challenges, the book explores how data fusion can be used within grid, distributed, and cloud computing architectures. Bringing together both theoretical and applied research perspectives, this is a valuable reference for fusion researchers and practitioners. It offers guidance and insight for those working on the complex issues of designing and implementing distributed, decentralized information fusion.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>If the furious debate around the state of healthcare in the US has led to any consensus, it’s that the system should be delivering better quality for less cost than it does. The truth is that our healthcare system is a sprawling mix of competing interests in which those of the patient are valued least. Too much discussion has devolved to simplistic scapegoating, and too few comprehensive, constructive solutions have been offered. It’s time for a fresh vision.<br/><br/>In straightforward language, <strong>Healthcare at a Turning Point: A Roadmap for Change</strong> outlines a new market-based business model that aligns industry financing mechanisms with the goals of prevention, improved quality, and reduced costs. Drawing on more than 25 years of cross-industry consulting experience, the authors:</p><ul><li>Articulate a market-based vision of the industry</li><li>Examine past efforts to reduce costs, their failures and their unanticipated consequences</li><li>Spotlight perverse incentives that distort the way the healthcare system operates and make it less than it could be</li><li>Present concrete recommendations for change within the healthcare delivery, insurance, pharmaceutical, device and diagnostics sectors</li><li>Explain the changes that employers, consumers and policy makers can make to create a more customer-responsive system that delivers more value</li></ul><p>For all the uncertainty in the current environment, there is also a rare opportunity to fundamentally redefine who wins in this market. <strong>Healthcare at a Turning Point</strong> provides guidance to executives ready for that contest as well as a roadmap for change.</p></span></span>",

Presented in three sections—Teletraffic Models of Random Input, Teletraffic Models of Quasi-Random Input, and Teletraffic Models of Batched Poisson Input—it covers everything that a professional experienced with optimization and dimensioning of telecom networks could ever need to know. </p><p>This unique book provides a detailed explanation on how efficient multirate teletraffic loss models are extracted and applied, and guides readers through almost all network technologies and services. Starting from the basics, it steadily increases in difficulty to keep the book self-contained and to provide a better understanding to those who might be new to the subject. It includes detailed explanations of the complex teletraffic models—many of which were developed by the authors. Tutorial examples, several backed by supplementary software, are accompanied by intermediate results and figures. Additionally, end-of-chapter applications describe the applicability of the models to modern network technologies, updating the incorporated teletraffic models of commercial packages/tools.</p><ul><li>Uses the classic EMLM (Erlang Multirate Loss Model) as its base to present a comprehensive range of teletraffic models through detailed explanation and numerical examples</li><li>Filled with the authors’ own original teletraffic models—making for a wholly unique learning experience</li><li>Offers a clear, self-contained presentation with a beginning, middle, and end</li><li>Starts with simple models, then moves to more complex models, before finishing with complicated ones</li><li>Supplemented by an accompanying website with computer implementation of the most important models </li></ul><p>Directed primarily at telecommunication engineers, <i>Efficient Multirate Teletraffic Loss Models Beyond Erlang</i> is also useful for telecom operators or managers on the higher and average levels, as well a Ph.D. students, researchers, and modelers.</p></span>",

Under the advanced and visionary approach of distributed intelligence, the authors focus on three distinct but tightly inter-related areas of developments for distributed sensing systems (DSS): firstly, the sensor technology embracing the conversion of the phenomena of interest into desirable form of signal such as electric, secondly, the interaction process between sensing points which requires immense intelligence loosely called networking, and finally, the adoption of useful maturing systems through potential applications for right impacts for a better life and a brighter economy. Furthermore, the book contains a number of case studies and typical applications illustrating the technical details, features and functions of the systems, as well as demonstrating their benefits and limitations.</p><p>Key Features:</p><ul><li><p>Discusses the technological developments lead by sensor technology</p></li><li><p>Addresses viable new applications</p></li><li><p>Contains a number of case studies and typical applications illustrating the technical details, features and functions of the systems</p></li><li><p>Demonstrates the benefits and limitations of distributed sensing</p></li><li><p>Written by experts with vast experience in the field (both in academia and industry)</p></li></ul><p>This book will be an invaluable reference for postgraduates studying related courses (communication engineering, engineering management, computer systems, industrial process, automation, design, environmental, urban, surveillance), R&amp;D engineers, system and application designers, researchers, industrial project managers and engineers, and technical and strategic managers planning new products.</p></span></span></span>",

However, shore-based VFDs often are unsuitable for shipboard applications because the power generation and distribution fundamentals are completely different. <i>VFD Challenges for Shipboard Electrical Power System Design</i> explores the problems presented by variable frequency drives as they are applied in shipboard power generation and distribution system design and offers solutions for meeting these challenges.</p><p>VFDs with configurations such as six pulse drive, 12 pulse drive, 18 pulse drive, active front end, pulse width modulation and many others generate many different levels of harmonics. These harmonics are often much higher than the regulations allow. This book covers a range of techniques used to provide ships with efficient energy that minimizes mechanical and electrical stress. This important book:</p><ul><li>Offers a comparison of shipboard grounding and VFD grounding</li><li>Contains an analysis of the VFD effect in terms of shipboard power quality</li><li>Includes specific examples of Department of Transportation standards regarding VFDs</li></ul><p>Written for commercial and naval engineers designing ships and/or shipboard power systems, <i>VFD Challenges for Shipboard Electrical Power System Design</i> is a comprehensive resource that addresses the problems and solutions associated with shipboard applications of VFD.</p></span>",
