			"description": "<span><p>\n“In this second edition of <em>Extreme Programming\nExplained,</em> Kent Beck organizes and presents five years’\nworth of experiences, growth, and change revolving around XP. If\nyou are seriously interested in understanding how you and your team\ncan start down the path of improvement with XP, you must read this\nbook.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Francesco Cirillo,</b> Chief Executive Officer, XPLabs\nS.R.L.\n</p><p>\n“The first edition of this book told us what XP\nwas—it changed the way many of us think about software\ndevelopment. This second edition takes it farther and gives us a\nlot more of the ‘why’ of XP, the motivations and the\nprinciples behind the practices. This is great stuff. Armed with\nthe ‘what’ and the ‘why,’ we can now all\nset out to confidently work on the ‘how’: how to run\nour projects better, and how to get agile techniques adopted in our\norganizations.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Dave Thomas,</b> The Pragmatic Programmers LLC\n</p><p>\n“This book is dynamite! It was revolutionary when it first\nappeared a few years ago, and this new edition is equally profound.\nFor those who insist on cookbook checklists, there’s an\nexcellent chapter on ‘primary practices,’ but I urge\nyou to begin by truly contemplating the meaning of the opening\nsentence in the first chapter of Kent Beck’s book: ‘XP\nis about social change.’ You should do whatever it takes to\nensure that every IT professional and every IT manager—all\nthe way up to the CIO—has a copy of <em>Extreme Programming\nExplained</em> on his or her desk.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Ed Yourdon,</b> author and consultant\n</p><p>\n“XP is a powerful set of concepts for simplifying the\nprocess of software design, development, and testing. It is about\nminimalism and incrementalism, which are especially useful\nprinciples when tackling complex problems that require a balance of\ncreativity and discipline.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Michael A. Cusumano,</b> Professor, MIT Sloan School of\nManagement, and author of <em>The Business of Software</em>\n</p><p>\n“<em>Extreme Programming Explained</em> is the work of a\ntalented and passionate craftsman. Kent Beck has brought together a\ncompelling collection of ideas about programming and management\nthat deserves your full attention. My only beef is that our\nprofession has gotten to a point where such common-sense ideas are\nlabeled ‘extreme.’...”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Lou Mazzucchelli,</b> Fellow, Cutter Business Technology\nCouncil\n</p><p>\n“If your organization is ready for a change in the way it\ndevelops software, there’s the slow incremental approach,\nfixing things one by one, or the fast track, jumping feet first\ninto Extreme Programming. Do not be frightened by the name, it is\nnot that extreme at all. It is mostly good old recipes and common\nsense, nicely integrated together, getting rid of all the fat that\nhas accumulated over the years.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Philippe Kruchten,</b> UBC, Vancouver, British\nColumbia\n</p><p>\n“Sometimes revolutionaries get left behind as the movement\nthey started takes on a life of its own. In this book, Kent Beck\nshows that he remains ahead of the curve, leading XP to its next\nlevel. Incorporating five years of feedback, this book takes a\nfresh look at what it takes to develop better software in less time\nand for less money. There are no silver bullets here, just a set of\npractical principles that, when used wisely, can lead to dramatic\nimprovements in software development productivity.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Mary Poppendieck,</b> author of <em>Lean Software\nDevelopment: An Agile Toolkit</em>\n</p><p>\n“Kent Beck has revised his classic book based on five more\nyears of applying and teaching XP. He shows how the path to XP is\nboth easy and hard: It can be started with fewer practices, and yet\nit challenges teams to go farther than ever.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>William Wake,</b> independent consultant\n</p><p>\n“With new insights, wisdom from experience, and clearer\nexplanations of the art of Extreme Programming, this edition of\nBeck’s classic will help many realize the dream of\noutstanding software development.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>Joshua Kerievsky,</b> author of <em>Refactoring to\nPatterns</em> and Founder, Industrial Logic, Inc.\n</p><p>\n“XP has changed the way our industry thinks about software\ndevelopment. Its brilliant simplicity, focused execution, and\ninsistence on fact-based planning over speculation have set a new\nstandard for software delivery.”<br/>\n<br/>\n—<b>David Trowbridge,</b> Architect, Microsoft\nCorporation\n</p><p>Accountability. Transparency. Responsibility. These are not\nwords that are often applied to software development.</p><p>In this completely revised introduction to Extreme Programming\n(XP), Kent Beck describes how to improve your software development\nby integrating these highly desirable concepts into your daily\ndevelopment process.</p><p>The first edition of <em>Extreme Programming Explained</em> is a\nclassic. It won awards for its then-radical ideas for improving\nsmall-team development, such as having developers write automated\ntests for their own code and having the whole team plan weekly.\nMuch has changed in five years. This completely rewritten second\nedition expands the scope of XP to teams of any size by suggesting\na program of continuous improvement based on:</p><li><p>Five core values consistent with excellence in software\ndevelopment</p></li><li><p>Eleven principles for putting those values into action</p></li><li><p>Thirteen primary and eleven corollary practices to help you\npush development past its current business and technical\nlimitations</p></li><p>Whether you have a small team that is already closely aligned\nwith your customers or a large team in a gigantic or multinational\norganization, you will find in these pages a wealth of ideas to\nchallenge, inspire, and encourage you and your team members to\nsubstantially improve your software development.</p><p>You will discover how to:</p><li><p>Involve the whole team—XP style</p></li><li><p>Increase technical collaboration through pair programming and\ncontinuous integration</p></li><li><p>Reduce defects through developer testing</p></li><li><p>Align business and technical decisions through weekly and\nquarterly planning</p></li><li><p>Improve teamwork by setting up an informative, shared\nworkspace</p></li><p>You will also find many other concrete ideas for improvement,\nall based on a philosophy that emphasizes simultaneously increasing\nthe humanity and effectiveness of software development.</p><p>Every team can improve. Every team can begin improving today.\nImprovement is possible—beyond what we can currently imagine.\n<b><em>Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition,</em></b> offers\nideas to fuel your improvement for years to come.</p><p><br/><br/></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Software development projects can be fun, productive, and even\ndaring. Yet they can consistently deliver value to a business and\nremain under control.</p><p>Extreme Programming (XP) was conceived and developed to address\nthe specific needs of software development conducted by small teams\nin the face of vague and changing requirements. This new\nlightweight methodology challenges many conventional tenets,\nincluding the long-held assumption that the cost of changing a\npiece of software necessarily rises dramatically over the course of\ntime. XP recognizes that projects have to work to achieve this\nreduction in cost and exploit the savings once they have been\nearned.</p><p>Fundamentals of XP include:</p><li><p>Distinguishing between the decisions to be made by business\ninterests and those to be made by project stakeholders.</p></li><li><p>Writing unit tests before programming and keeping all of the\ntests running at all times.</p></li><li><p>Integrating and testing the whole system--several times a\nday.</p></li><li><p>Producing all software in pairs, two programmers at one\nscreen.</p></li><li><p>Starting projects with a simple design that constantly evolves\nto add needed flexibility and remove unneeded complexity.</p></li><li><p>Putting a minimal system into production quickly and growing it\nin whatever directions prove most valuable.</p></li><p>Why is XP so controversial? Some sacred cows don't make the cut\nin XP:</p><li><p>Don't force team members to specialize and become analysts,\narchitects, programmers, testers, and integrators--every XP\nprogrammer participates in all of these critical activities every\nday.</p></li><li><p>Don't conduct complete up-front analysis and design--an XP\nproject starts with a quick analysis of the entire system, and XP\nprogrammers continue to make analysis and design decisions\nthroughout development.</p></li><li><p>Develop infrastructure and frameworks as you develop your\napplication, not up-front--delivering business value is the\nheartbeat that drives XP projects.</p></li><li><p>Don't write and maintain implementation\ndocumentation--communication in XP projects occurs face-to-face, or\nthrough efficient tests and carefully written code.</p></li><p>You may love XP, or you may hate it, but <b><em>Extreme\nProgramming Explained</em></b> will force you to take a fresh look\nat how you develop software.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201616416B04062001</p></span></span>",

Its incredibly fast branching ability transformed a piece of code from a niche tool for Linux Kernel developers into a mainstream distributed versioning system. Like most powerful tools, Git can be hard to approach since it has a lot of commands, subcommands, and options that easily confuse newcomers.</p><p>The 2nd edition of this very successful book will help you overcome this fear and become adept in all the basic tasks in Git. Building upon the success of the first book, we start with a brief step-by-step installation guide; after this, you'll delve into the essentials of Git. For those of you who have bought the first edition, this time we go into internals in far greater depth, talking less about theory and using much more practical examples.</p><p>The book serves as a primer for topics to follow, such as branching and merging, creating and managing a GitHub personal repository, and fork and pull requests. You'll then learn the art of cherry-picking, taking only the commits you want, followed by Git blame. Finally, we'll see how to interoperate with a Subversion server, covering the concepts and commands needed to convert an SVN repository into a Git repository.</p><p>To conclude, this is a collection of resources, links, and appendices to satisfy even the most curious.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This short guide will help you understand the concepts and fundamentals of GIT is a step-by-step manner.</p></span>",

Despite the\n\"extreme\" in its name, XP actually reduces risks--the risk of\nputting out software that is faulty, out of date at its release,\nover budget, or not fully capable of performing the tasks for which\nit was intended. Initially considered radical, XP has proven itself\nsuccessful and is entering the mainstream of software development.\nThe greatest challenge now facing software development managers and\nengineers is how to implement this beneficial approach.</p><p><b><em>Extreme Programming Installed</em></b> explains the core\nprinciples of Extreme Programming and details each step in the XP\ndevelopment cycle.

			"description": "<span><p>This book is a step-by-step guide to building your own SharePoint farm in a home lab setting. Learn how to build a windows domain and then join servers into the domain in order to create your own testing and learning environment. After you get the domain stood up, where you go from there is up to you. This book will help you learn how to spin up SharePoint in a least privileged fashion. This isn't strictly a SharePoint book, though. For example, if you're not a SharePoint professional and are just looking to create a working windows domain for other purposes; the home-lab domain that you'll create will work great for Exam preparation for non-SharePoint purposes. You could even use it for learning how to install Exchange Server. After all, it's your Home Lab domain. In this book you will build your home-lab domain and you'll have a great place for learning how to administer SharePoint and develop SharePoint Apps. Here are just some of the tasks you'll complete in easy to follow exercises:</p><ul><li><p>Create a windows domain and a certificate authority, so that you can run SharePoint on SSL</p></li><li><p>Join servers to the domain and configure other technology on the member servers as needed</p></li><li><p>Install SQL Server, and correctly partition the server in accordance with best practices</p></li><li><p>Install and configure a SharePoint farm</p></li><li><p>Spin up Host Named Site Collections (HNSC's)</p></li><li><p>Install and configure Visual Studio</p></li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For:</b></p><p>This book is suitable for both developers and administrators. No technical knowledge is assumed beyond a general familiarity with computers and computing terminology. The resulting domain will be suitable for both IT and developer testing needs.</p></span>",

			"title": "Java Extreme Programming Cookbook",
			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nExtreme Programming does not mean programming naked while\nrollerblading down the side of the Grand Canyon. It does mean a new\napproach to software development that is both radical and\ncommon-sense. Unlike many software development methodologies, XP\nhas been accepted quickly because its core practices--particularly\ncode sharing, test-first development, and continuous\nintegration--resonated immediately with software developers\neverywhere. Instead of impressing developers with a body of theory,\nXP got programmers to say, \"Yeah, that's how I'd like to work.\"\nOddly enough, although most developers turn to Extreme Programming\nmethods in order to code real, hands-on, and extensible projects\nquickly (\"Code comes first\"), most books on Extreme Programming\ninsist on focusing on the theory and not the practice. Not the\n<em>Java Extreme Programming Cookbook</em>. Brimming with over 100\n\"recipes\" for getting down to business and actually doing XP, the\n<em>Java Extreme Programming Cookbook</em> doesn't try to \"sell\" you\non XP; it succinctly documents the most important features of\npopular open source tools for XP in Java--including Ant, Junit,\nHttpUnit, Cactus, Tomcat, XDoclet--and then digs right in,\nproviding recipes for implementing the tools in real-world\nenvironments. Each recipe offers solutions that help you put an\nextreme programming environment together: then provides code for\nautomating the build process and testing. Although the time saved\nusing any one of these solutions will more than pay for the book,\n<em>Java Extreme Programming Cookbook</em> offers more than just a\ncollection of cut-and-paste code. Each recipe also includes\nexplanations of how and why the approach works, so you can adapt\nthe techniques to similar situations. One of the biggest challenges\nfacing developers today is sorting through the wide variety of\ntools available form various source and figuring out how to them\neffectively. The recipes in <em>Java Extreme Programming\nCookbook</em> showcase how to use the most important features of\nthese XP tools. Many of these tools are geared towards unit\ntesting, while others are invaluable for continuous integration;\nwith these practical examples, you'll be able to choose the most\neffective tools to accomplish your goals, then implement them in a\ncohesive development environment quickly. If you want to set up a\ntest-driven development environment that allows you to focus on\nwriting testable code--now--this book will prove invaluable.\n</p></span></span></span>",

I\npredict that it will be as essential to the present generation as\nthe S.E.I. and its Capability Maturity Model were to the\nlast.\"</em></p><p>\n--From the foreword by Tom DeMarco\n</p><p>The hallmarks of Extreme Programming--constant integration and\nautomated testing, frequent small releases that incorporate\ncontinual customer feedback, and a teamwork approach--make it an\nexceptionally flexible and effective approach to software\ndevelopment. Once considered radical, Extreme Programming (XP) is\nrapidly becoming recognized as an approach particularly well-suited\nto small teams facing vague or rapidly changing requirements--that\nis, the majority of projects in today's fast-paced software\ndevelopment world.</p><p>Within this context of flexibility and rapid-fire changes,\nplanning is critical; without it, software projects can quickly\nfall apart. Written by acknowledged XP authorities Kent Beck and\nMartin Fowler, <em>Planning Extreme Programming</em> presents the\napproaches, methods, and advice you need to plan and track a\nsuccessful Extreme Programming project. The key XP philosophy:\nPlanning is not a one-time event, but a constant process of\nreevaluation and course-correction throughout the lifecycle of the\nproject.</p><p>You will learn how planning is essential to controlling\nworkload, reducing programmer stress, increasing productivity, and\nkeeping projects on track. Planning Extreme Programming also\nfocuses on the importance of estimating the cost and time for each\nuser story (requirement), determining its priority, and planning\nsoftware releases accordingly.</p><p>Specific topics include:</p><ul><li><p>Planning and the four key variables: cost, quality, time, and\nscope</p></li><li><p>Deciding how many features to incorporate into a release</p></li><li><p>Estimating scope, time, and effort for user stories</p></li><li><p>Prioritizing user stories</p></li><li><p>Balancing the business value and technical risk of user\nstories</p></li><li><p>Rebuilding the release plan based on customer and programmer\ninput</p></li><li><p>Choosing the iteration length</p></li><li><p>Tracking an iteration</p></li><li><p>What to do when you're not going to make the date</p></li><li><p>Dealing with bugs</p></li><li><p>Making changes to the team</p></li><li><p>Outsourcing</p></li><li><p>Working with business contracts</p></li></ul><p>In addition, this book alerts you to the red flags that signal\nserious problems: customers who won't make decisions, growing\ndefect reports, failing daily builds, and more. An entire chapter\nis devoted to war stories from the trenches that illustrate the\nreal-world problems many programmers encounter and the solutions\nthey've devised.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n0201710919B04062001</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>Create, merge, and distribute code with Git, the most powerful and flexible versioning system available</b></p><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Since its inception, Git has attracted skilled developers due to its robust, powerful, and reliable features. Its incredibly fast branching ability transformed a piece of code from a niche tool for former Linux Kernel developers into a mainstream distributed versioning system. Like most powerful tools, Git can be hard to approach since it has a lot of commands, subcommands, and options that easily confuse newcomers. The main purpose of Git Essentials is to help you overcome this fear and become adept at all basic tasks in Git. This book starts with an introduction to version control systems, and after this you'll delve deeply into the essentials of Git. This serves as a primer for the topics to follow such as branching and merging, creating and managing a GitHub personal repository, and fork and pull requests. You will then learn the art of cherry-picking, taking only commits you like, followed by Git blame. Finally, you'll learn how to migrate from SVN using Git tools or TortoiseGit and migrate from other VCSs, concluding with a collection of resources, links, and appendices.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Create, branch, and merge a local repository</li><li>Transport your work to a remote repository working in a centralized manner</li><li>Organize your source code using feature branches</li><li>Organize the development flow</li><li>Get a meaningful changelog using clear commit messages</li><li>Collaborate with teammates without any impediments</li><li>Experiment with your code without affecting functional code files</li><li>Explore some tools used to migrate to Git from other versioning systems without losing your development history</li><li>Extend your knowledge of Git with some useful resources</li></ul></span>",

Yet, in today’s dynamic workforce, web development is a highly social endeavor where developers collaborate with one another to build complex systems. This report provides guidelines for working effectively with other developers, particularly when it comes to making compromises, writing documentation, and interacting with open source in ways you can’t achieve as a solo learner.</p><p>Author Adam Scott explores widely accepted methods for writing quality code, contributing work to open source, improving your documentation practices, and—perhaps most critical—respecting and involving every member of your team. As part of the series on ethical web development, this report emphasizes how empathetic development practices like these will help you create empathetic products.</p><p>You’ll learn guidelines to help you:</p><ul><li>Produce quality code by leveraging coding standards, version control, testing, and automated checks in a team environment</li><li>Release your project code as open source, complete with clear documentation and codes of conduct</li><li>Write useful code documentation that’s comprehensive, welcoming, and collaborative</li><li>Create an inclusive and safe environment for fellow developers, both at work and at group events</li></ul>This is the fourth report in the Ethical Web Development series from author Adam Scott.

They present strong identities centered on collaboration, exchange, sense of community, and co-creation, which are expected to create a physical and social atmosphere that facilitates positive social interaction, knowledge sharing, and information exchange. This book explores the complex experiences and social dynamics that emerge within and between collaborative spaces and how they impact, sometimes unexpectedly, on creativity and innovation.</p><p><em>Collaborative Spaces at Work</em> is timely and relevant: it will address the gap in critical understandings of the role and outcomes of collaborative spaces. Advancing the debate beyond regional development rhetoric, the book will investigate, through various empirical studies, if and how collaborative spaces do actually support innovation and the generation of new ideas, products, and processes.</p><p>The book is intended as a primary reference in creativity and innovation, workspaces, knowledge and creative workers, and urban studies. Given its short chapters and strong empirical orientation, it will also appeal to policy makers interested in urban regeneration, sustaining innovation, and social and economic development, and to managers of both collaborative spaces and companies who want to foster creativity within larger organizations. It can also serve as a textbook in master’s degrees and PhD courses on innovation and creativity, public management, urban studies, management of work, and labor relations.</p></span>",

You don't need a background in Microsoft technologies; you’ll learn how to rapidly build and customize sites entirely on the front end, starting with out-of-the-box features and extending them with HTML and JavaScript code. </p><p>The book starts with an introduction to working with SharePoint on the front end, and how this can help you avoid common pitfalls associated with deploying custom code on the server. You’ll start by using SharePoint’s browser-based tools to place and manipulate out-of-the-box web parts on a page. Then learn to inject some simple HTML and JavaScript to manipulate these web parts, and use JSLink to rapidly style and manipulate data in the List web part. You'll also see examples of how to build your own custom web parts using HTML, JavaScript and CSS.</p><p>For those who want to dive deeper into JavaScript on SharePoint, chapters cover working directly with built-in JavaScript methods and properties and the JavaScript object model (JSOM), and how to work with the powerful new REST API, which gives you the ultimate flexibility over what you do with your data. </p><p>Whatever your background, whether it's web development, working with SharePoint on the server side, or if you're a SharePoint user looking to learn new skills, <em>Custom SharePoint Solutions with HTML and JavaScript</em> will show you how to get what you want from SharePoint, quickly and reliably.</p></span></span></span></span>",

We¿ve heard success stories\nabout sweeping changes made to organizations as a result of XP.\nWe’ve read books about how this approach can work for our\nteams. However, are there times when XP isn’t appropriate?\nThere are certainly instances when making the leap to XP could\npotentially jeopardize a whole project. What’s missing from\nall of this rhetoric? Witness Pete McBreen, software craftsman,\nexamine the issue from both sides.</p><p>In <em><b>Questioning Extreme Programming</b></em>, the author\nhelps you examine and answer the following questions:</p><li><p>Is the cost of change really low?</p></li><li><p>Does XP allow proper testing?</p></li><li><p>Does XP make sense?</p></li><li><p>Is XP a return to the dark ages?</p></li><li><p>Can we adopt XP practices for other approaches?</p></li><li><p>Do you need process improvement or process change?</p></li><li><p>Why are developers so zealous about adopting XP?</p></li><li><p>Is XP suitable for your projects?</p></li><li><p>What is the next step after Extreme Programming?</p></li><p>After reading this thought-provoking book, software developers\ncan make informed decisions about Extreme Programming, and whether\nit is suitable for their organization.

			"title": "Version Control with Subversion",
			"description": "<span><p>One of the greatest frustrations in most software projects is version control: the art of managing changes to information. Today's increasingly fast pace of software development--as programmers make small changes to software one day only to undo them the next--has only heightened the problem; consecutive work on code or single-programmer software is a rare sight these days. Without careful attention to version control, concurrent and collaborative work can create more headaches than it solves. This is where Subversion comes into play.Written by members of the Subversion open source development team, <i>Version Control with Subversion</i> introduces the powerful new versioning tool designed to be the successor to the Concurrent Version System or CVS.  CVS users will find the \"look and feel\" Subversion comfortably familiar, but under the surface it's far more flexible, robust, and usable, and more importantly, it improves on CVS's more notable flaws.The book begins with a general introduction to Subversion, the basic concepts behind version control, and a guided tour of Subversion's capabilities and structure.  With thorough attention to detail, the authors cover every aspect of installing and configuring Subversion for managing a programming project, documentation, or any other team-based endeavor.  Later chapters cover the more complex topics of branching, repository administration, and other advanced features such as properties, externals, and access control.  The book ends with reference material and appendices covering a number of useful topics such as a Subversion complete reference and troubleshooting guide.<i>Version Control with Subversion</i> aims to be useful to readers of widely different backgrounds, from those with no previous experience in version control to experienced sysadmins.  If you've never used version control, you'll find everything you need to get started in this book. And if you're a seasoned CVS pro, this book will help you make a painless leap into Subversion.</p></span>",

One proven technology gives them all the\ntools and resources they need to achieve these goals:\nSilverlight®. Using Silverlight and SharePoint together,\ndevelopers can create state-of-the-art applications that utilize\nSilverlight’s outstanding user experience, and fully leverage\nthe vast collections of business data already stored in corporate\nSharePoint deployments. In SharePoint 2010 Development with\nSilverlight, two SharePoint gurus collaborate to teach all the\nconcepts and techniques needed to create robust Silverlight\nsolutions for delivery through SharePoint 2010, and present fully\ndocumented code that demonstrates superior design and\nprogramming.</p><p>Bob German and Paul Stubbs draw on their\nextensive experience developing custom SharePoint business\nsolutions with Silverlight and presenting on these technologies at\nleading Microsoft developer events. Writing for both experienced\nand new SharePoint developers, they quickly review the fundamentals\nof both SharePoint and Silverlight development, and then\ndemonstrate how to use both platforms together to build uniquely\npowerful solutions. These include:</p><p><br/>\n• Simple and connected Silverlight Web Parts (Chapter 5) and\nSilverlight Web Part Editing (Chapters 7 and 10)</p><p>• Advanced use of the SharePoint\nClient Object Model including dynamic loading, paging, and\nserver-side exception handling (Chapter 8)</p><p>• Use of SharePoint’s REST API\nincluding paging, caching, and filtering (Chapter 9)</p><p>• Integration with SharePoint search\nand social networking (Chapter 10)</p><p>• Solutions that improve performance\nand reduce server traffic by passing serialized .NET objects on the\nweb page (Chapter 7)</p><p>• Use of SharePoint’s JavaScript\nAPI with JQuery (Chapter 7)</p><p>• SharePoint applications for Windows\nPhone 7 (Chapter 12)</p><p>• Integration with Office 365 and\nWindows Azure™ services (Chapter 14)</p><p>• Silverlight field types in\nSharePoint, featuring a mapping field that allows geocoding\nSharePoint content (Chapter 15)</p><p> <b> </b></p><p><b>Including New Features in Silverlight\n5</b></p><p>Silverlight 5 introduces a number of new\nfeatures such as implicit data templates and debugging data binding\nthat can be very helpful in SharePoint solutions.

And if you have Windows 2003 Server, then you already have SharePoint, since it's built right in.  But before you can enjoy the benefits of SharePoint, you need to know how to turn it on, set it up, and get your applications working with it.<i>Essential Sharepoint</i> will help you do just that.  It's not only the most complete guide for setting up and using these increasingly popular sites, but it also explains in detail the integration that makes SharePoint exciting. Everything you need to know about SharePoint is covered, including:</p><ul><li>hosting choices</li><li>administration</li><li>customization</li><li>integration with Microsoft Office</li><li>developing new SharePoint functionality</li><li>when to use SharePoint portal server</li></ul><i>Essential Sharepoint</i> covers all the key topics for getting up and running with this powerful and popular set of collaboration tools.

Microsoft's SharePoint helps teams and organizations close the distance. With SharePoint, groups construct web sites specifically for collaboration--sites where individuals can capture and share ideas, and work together on documents, tasks, contacts, and events. It's the next best thing to being in the room together.Unfortunately, much of the documentation for SharePoint is written to help system administrators get it up and running, which often leaves end users in the dark. The <i>SharePoint User's Guide</i> takes another approach: this quick and easy guide shows you what you need to know to start using SharePoint effectively and how to get the most from it.  You'll learn how to create sites that your organization can use to work together or independently, from an end user's point of view. Now, even beginners can learn how to:</p><ul><li>access sites that are already set up</li><li>create new sites</li><li>personalize sites</li><li>use the document and picture libraries for adding and editing content</li><li>add discussion boards and surveys to a site</li><li>enhance security</li></ul>You'll learn how you can receive alerts to tell you when existing documents and information have been changed, or when new information or documents have been added.  You can even share select information with partners or customers outside your organization. No one that uses SharePoint collaboration services can afford to be without this handy book.The <i>SharePoint User's Guide</i> is designed to help you find answers quickly, explaining key concepts and major points in straightforward language.  With SharePoint, any team or organization can overcome geographic or time-zone challenges, and the <i>SharePoint User's Guide</i> will show them how.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><div><p><b>A must have guide for creating engaging and usable SharePoint 2010 branding</b></p><p>With SharePoint 2010, Microsoft has provided a more robust environment for creating collaboration and content management sites that rival any of the popular websites on the internet. Creating a branded SharePoint site involves understanding both traditional web design techniques as well as topics that are typically reserved for developers. This book bridges that gap by not only providing expert guidance for creating beautiful public facing and internal intranet sites but it also addresses the needs of those readers that only want to understand the basics enough to apply some style to their sites.</p><p>Things like creative design, the experience visitors have navigating your user interface, ease of use, these are all important branding considerations and not always intuitive. This unique book from a team of SharePoint branding experts lays it all out. The book is divided into four sections:</p><p><b>Introduction to SharePoint Branding:</b> In this part you will learn about what SharePoint branding is and how the topic has changed since SharePoint 2007.</p><p><b>Branding Basics:</b> This section is geared towards both getting started as well as being a guide for people that don't want to dive super deep into the advanced topics of SharePoint branding. You will learn about how to plan for branding projects, including creating wireframes and creative mockups as well as gathering requirements and estimation. You will learn how to work with SharePoint Designer 2010, SharePoint 2010 themes, and SharePoint navigation as well as gain an understanding of the low and medium effort approaches to branding can be used to make SharePoint look more like your own visual style.</p><p><b>Advanced Branding:</b> This is where you will learn about the more intricate techniques for making large changes to the SharePoint UI, such as cascading style sheets (CSS), master pages, page layouts, web parts and XSLT. You will also get an introduction to deploying SharePoint branding to production servers using solution packages (WSP).</p><p><b>Other Topics:</b> Everything else that is related to SharePoint branding is discussed here, including working with the SharePoint 2010 ribbon and client side technologies such as the client object model, jQuery, and Silverlight.</p><p>Whether you want to make SharePoint look completely different or just make minor design changes, this expert guide will provide tips, techniques, and insights to get the job done.</p></div></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Web sites. Collaboration. Document management. Paperless offices. We want it all in business today, but how do you achieve all of these goals? More importantly, if you work for one of the millions of small to medium-sized businesses, how do you find the time and build the expertise necessary to reach these goals? Even the most powerful tool will not allow you to succeed unless you can get the majority of your staff to use it efficiently and effectively. You need a guide that demonstrates a platform small to medium-sized businesses can use to reach these goals.</p><p><i>Office and SharePoint 2007 User's Guide: Integrating SharePoint with Excel, Outlook, Access and Word</i> demystifies the path every Microsoft Office user can follow to benefit from the synergism of tools they are already familiar with. Together with SharePoint 2007, users can achieve goals like web sites with a consistent single view, improved collaboration within their organization, better document management, and maybe even get one step closer to the paperless office we've been promised for years. This book has topics for Office users of all skill levels, from those just starting to use Office tools to the experienced power user. It examines each major Office tool and shows how it contributes to the support and use of SharePoint in today's increasingly electronic-based office environment.</p></span>",

			"title": "Collaborative Environmental Management",
			"description": "<span><p>Collaboration has become a popular approach to environmental policy, planning, and management. At the urging of citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and industry, government officials at all levels have experimented with collaboration. Yet questions remain about the roles that governments play in collaboration--whether they are constructive and support collaboration, or introduce barriers. This thoughtful book analyzes a series of cases to understand how collaborative processes work and whether government can be an equal partner even as government agencies often formally control decision making and are held accountable for the outcomes. Looking at examples where government has led, encouraged, or followed in collaboration, the authors assess how governmental actors and institutions affected the way issues were defined, the resources available for collaboration, and the organizational processes and structures that were established. Cases include collaborative efforts to manage watersheds, rivers, estuaries, farmland, endangered species habitats, and forests. The authors develop a new theoretical framework and demonstrate that government left a heavy imprint in each of the efforts. The work concludes by discussing the choices and challenges faced by governmental institutions and actors as they try to realize the potential of collaborative environmental management.</p></span>",

Written by a four-time SharePoint MVP, <em>Beginning SharePoint 2010 Administration</em> begins with a comparison of SharePoint 2010 compared to the previous version and then examines the differences between SharePoint Foundation (SPF) and SharePoint Server (SPS).</p><p>This book is written for several audiences. One audience is consultants and IT professionals who need to understand how to plan, implement, and configure SharePoint. Another audience is administrators and the support team that must know how to manage SharePoint, both the more advanced administration of service applications and site collections, as well as managing sites and workspaces. A third audience is the reader who wants to understand how SharePoint works and what to expect from it; this is typically IT managers and project leaders.</p><p>This book assumes no previous knowledge of SharePoint, but if you do have experience with SharePoint you will learn how SharePoint 2010 differs from previous releases. If you intend to read and try all the exercises in this book, you will need some basic understanding of network applications such as Windows Servers, Microsoft SQL Server, Active Directory, DNS and IIS, as well as experience with Microsoft Office. If you don't intend to install SharePoint yourself, then it is not necessary to have that network understanding.</p><p><b>What This Book Covers</b></p><p>This book consists of 10 chapters and 4 appendixes. If you want to learn how to install and configure SharePoint Foundation, you should start reading Appendixes A and B. If you will install SharePoint Server 2010, you should still quickly read Appendixes A and B, since they cover the basic functionality also valid for SharePoint Server; then you should continue reading carefully Appendixes C and D. All these appendixes are very technical and detailed, but you need to understand all this in order to install a SharePoint 2010 environment that follows Microsoft's Best Practice to match the requirements of your organization.</p><p>If you don't plan to install SharePoint yourself, then you can start reading Chapter 1 and all the other chapters. If some of them are less interesting to you, you should still read them quickly to get an understanding of what they cover. Later you might need that information, and then it will be valuable to know where to find it.</p><p>The main part of this book is divided into 10 chapters. Some of these chapters focus more on SharePoint Foundation (SPF), some on SharePoint Server (SPS):</p><ul><li><p><b>Chapter 1, \"Introduction to Microsoft SharePoint 2010\":</b> This chapter gives you an overview of SharePoint and most of its important features. If you want to understand what SharePoint 2010 can do for you, then read this chapter.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 2, \"Building SPF Sites\":</b> This chapter focuses on the fundamental features of SharePoint 2010; if you plan to build an SPF-based solution, read this. If you plan to build an SPS solution, this chapter covers the basic functionality you also need to know.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 3, \"Office Integration\":</b> This chapter describes how SharePoint 2010 integrates with MS Office. If you are interested in document management features in SharePoint, then you should read this chapter.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 4, \"Content Management in SharePoint 2010\":</b> This chapter focus on managing content, especially web content management using wiki pages, but also social computing features, integration with offline solutions like MS Outlook and SharePoint Workspace, and managing multilanguage sites.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 5, \"Managing My Sites\":</b> This chapter focus on features only available in SPS, not SPF. It describes how to manage and and take advantage of the user's personal My Site, both for personal use and for collaboration and information sharing.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 6, \"SharePoint Administration\":</b> This chapter is a deep dive into many important features in SharePoint, such as permissions, templates, search and indexing, and how to manage SharePoint 2010 with PowerShell and STSADM. Readers only interested in SPF should read the parts that covers SPF features, while the SPS administrator and IT pro should read the complete chapter.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 7, \"Building Intranets and Internet Portals\":</b> This chapter focuses on features related to intranets and public-facing Internet sites. It explains what features will be of interest and how to use them. You will get a number of tips in this chapter, such as how to display Twitter content on a SharePoint site.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 8, \"Customizing SharePoint 2010\":</b> This chapter explains how to customize both SPF and SPS sites. You will learn how to use SharePoint Designer 2010 as well as how to customize web parts, including Silverlight-based media web parts.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 9, \"Using SharePoint Designer 2010\":</b> This chapter focus on what you can do with the free tool SharePoint Designer 2010. If you need to know how to configure and design web pages in SharePoint, this chapter is for you.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 10, \"Backup and Restore\":</b> This chapter describes how to backup and then restore documents, lists, sites, site collections, and complete SharePoint farms, using SharePoint Central Administration, PowerShell, and STSADM. If you are a SharePoint administrator, you should read this chapter.</p></li><li><p><b>Appendix A, \"Installing SharePoint Foundation 2010\":</b> This appendix describes how to plan and implement SharePoint Foundation 2010. It also covers how to upgrade from WSS 3.0.</p></li><li><p><b>Appendix B, \"Configuring SharePoint Foundation 2010\":</b> This appendix describes how to configure and manage a newly installed SPF environment. It covers many important and general concepts in SharePoint that are also valid for SPS, so both SPF and SPS administrators and IT professionals should read this appendix.</p></li><li><p><b>Appendix C, \"Installing SharePoint Server 2010\":</b> This appendix describes how to plan and implement SharePoint Server 2010, including how to upgrade and migrate from MOSS 2007.</p></li><li><p><b>Appendix D, \"Configuring SharePoint Server 2010\":</b> This appendix describes how to configure and manage a newly created SPS 2010 environment. Before you read this appendix you should read Appendix B.</p></li></ul></span></span>",

You'll not only encounter interesting code samples, but also see how to combine these examples with the Microsoft collaboration platform's services. The book's solutions focus on using Visual Studio 2008 and its built-in Office development tools to construct the user interface layer. And solutions can interact with SharePoint as a service provider, taking advantage of SharePoint's many collaboration features like document repositories, collaboration sites, and search functions.</p><p>This book is unique because it starts with challenges that end users deal with every day when using the Microsoft collaboration platform to support business processes. The solutions are presented as hypothetical business challenges of a fictional company. By presenting the examples in this context, author Ed Hild makes it easier to relate to the challenges and solution value. The goal of these examples is to build applications that apply the benefits of the Office desktop interface to the richness of SharePoint collaboration features. This book will help you develop real-world solutions to complex business problems and challenges.</p></span></span></span></span>",

			"title": "Beginning SharePoint® 2010 Development",
			"description": "<span><span><p><b>Discover how to take advantage of the many new features in SharePoint 2010</b></p><p>SharePoint 2010 is a significant leap forward from the 2007 release, and 'you will find that there are a ton of features built into the platform for you to leverage in your solution development. Because SharePoint is a broad platform that covers a lot, this book also covers quite a bit of ground. As a <em>Wrox Beginning</em> book, the goal of <em>Beginning SharePoint 2010 Development</em> is to get you started with many of the fundamentals so that you can continue on to advanced programming beyond this book.</p><p>In this book, you will see coverage of the following:</p><li><p>Getting started with development for SharePoint 2010</p></li><li><p>Becoming familiar with tools that you will use to develop for SharePoint</p></li><li><p>Becoming familiar with common SharePoint development tasks</p></li><li><p>Programming against lists and developing custom Web parts</p></li><li><p>Integrating line-of-business (LOB) data with SharePoint and Microsoft Office</p></li><li><p>Integrating Silverlight and SharePoint</p></li><li><p>Creating service-oriented solutions for SharePoint</p></li><li><p>Integrating SharePoint and Microsoft Office</p></li><li><p>Security fundamentals in SharePoint</p></li><p>This book will not cover SharePoint 2007, but will cover areas that span SharePoint Foundation 2010 and SharePoint Server 2010.</p><p>The book's goal is to quickly take you from the basics of SharePoint, to installing and configuring a development environment, and then into how you can develop for SharePoint. The book is heavy on coding exercises, but tries to stick to a common set of .NET patterns to ensure you walk away with understanding the different ways in which you can code for SharePoint. Moving from beginning to advanced means that you can expect the walkthroughs and chapters to become increasingly more complex within each chapter and throughout the book. The walkthroughs have been created to be concise and to guide you through all of the steps you must accomplish to complete a coding task.</p><p>The structure of the book mimics the development ramp-up cycle for SharePoint. That is, you must first understand the breadth of the SharePoint platform. You then install it and the development environment; and then you begin to code - simple at first, but tasks that grow increasingly more complex. You will find that when coding against SharePoint, you may do certain things more (such as programming against lists and creating custom Web Parts). As such, these topics are covered in Part II of the book. Also, you may find that, as you advance in your SharePoint development, you will need to incorporate either Silverlight or Web services in your SharePoint solutions. Because you would likely combine these types of tasks inside of a custom Web Part, list-based application, or event receiver, these were placed in Part III of the book.</p><p><em>Beginning SharePoint 2010 Development is</em> aimed at the developer who is new to SharePoint. The book assumes you have some programming experience and a passion to learn how to develop for SharePoint. But this book does not assume that you've programmed against SharePoint before. With regard to your general development background, the two assumptions in this book are that you have some familiarity with Web development, and you have an understanding of .NET programming. With regard to Web development, this book assumes that you understand HTML, and may have an understanding of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Extensible Markup Language/Extensible Stylesheet Language (XML/XSL), and dynamic languages such as JavaScript. You may have a light understanding of ASP.NET and are looking to apply this knowledge to the SharePoint space. In any case, you have some understanding of the fundamentals of Web and .NET development, and are looking to apply those to the SharePoint space.</p></span></span>",

You will find some chapters that seem to cover general WSS 3.0 topics, but everything is treated in the context of a Publishing site. While the chapters are arranged in a logical order, it is not necessary to read the book from cover to cover in a linear fashion. The following is a brief description of each chapter:</p><li><p><b>Chapter 1, \"Embarking on Web Content Management Projects\"—</b>This chapter explains what this book is all about, who the target audience is, and who will benefit most from the book. It also details what the reader needs in terms of a local development environment in order to implement the solutions. In addition, each of the subsequent chapters is explained very briefly to provide an overview and clarify how each chapter fits in.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 2, \"Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Development Primer\"—</b>This chapter covers the fundamentals of WSS, including definitions of terms such as farm, Web application, site collection, site, list, and document library, and the general architecture of WSS. Some basic object model techniques are demonstrated in this chapter.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 3, \"Overview of Office SharePoint Server 2007 and Web Content Management\"—</b>This chapter briefly explains each of the various components that make up MOSS. In addition, while the book is development-focused, the \"ABCs\" of content-centric Internet sites is covered.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 4, \"SharePoint Features and the Solution Framework\"—</b>Both new to WSS 3.0, the SharePoint Feature and solution frameworks are covered in great detail in this chapter, as well as a process for automatically creating WSS solution packages on every project build.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 5, \"Minimal Publishing Site Definition\"—</b>Many users create new WCM sites by using the Publishing Portal template. Unfortunately, this adds quite a bit of unnecessary content to the site. This chapter picks apart the Publishing Portal template and Publishing Features and demonstrates how to create a minimal Publishing Portal template.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 6, \"Site Columns, Content Types, and Lists\"—</b>Three core components to every WSS 3.0 site—site columns, content types, and lists—are covered in this chapter.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 7, \"Master Pages and Page Layouts\"—</b>This chapter covers everything you need to know about creating, editing, and leveraging master pages and page layouts within Publishing sites.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 8, \"Navigation\"—</b>While WSS 3.0's navigation is founded on the ASP.NET 2.0 navigation provider framework, there are a few SharePoint-specific topics, which are covered in this chapter.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 9, \"Accessibility\"—</b>If it's not already, accessibility is becoming an increasingly important topic with regard to Web sites. This chapter explains the different levels of accessibility and discusses some techniques and tools developers can leverage to create sites for users with disabilities.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 10, \"Field Types and Field Controls\"—</b>Although it's a WSS 3.0 concept, field types and field controls are covered in this chapter in the context of a Publishing site. This includes creating custom field types with custom values types and controls, as well as custom field controls that leverage existing field types.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 11, \"Web Parts\"—</b>This chapter covers creating custom Web Parts and some advanced topics related to custom Web Part development, such as Editor Parts, customizing the Verbs menu, and leveraging asynchronous programming techniques. This chapter also covers the three Publishing-specific Web Parts and some advanced customization and styling options of the Content Query Web Part.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 12, \"Leveraging Workflow\"—</b>The Windows Workflow Foundation, part of the .NET Framework 3.0, is fully leveraged by WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007. This chapter explains how to create custom workflows using Visual Studio and leveraging InfoPath Web-rendered forms.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 13, \"Search\"—</b>Every content-centric site needs a robust search offering. This chapter explains the different components of MOSS search, as well as many customization opportunities such as modifying the search results.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 14, \"Authoring Experience Extensibility\"—</b>While the authoring experience in Publishing sites is quite robust, at times developers need to extend this offering for specific content owner requirements. This chapter covers this, including customizing the Page Editing Toolbar and the Rich Text Editor HTML field control.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 15, \"Authentication and Authorization\"—</b>This chapter covers everything you need to know about the ASP.NET 2.0 authentication provider model SharePoint fully leverages.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 16, \"Implementing Sites with Multiple Languages and Devices\"—</b>This chapter covers the topic of maintaining sites that need to offer their content in multiple languages, as well as developing custom Web Parts that are multilingual aware.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 17, \"Content Deployment\"—</b>A common request for larger content-centric Web sites is to have an internal authoring environment for content and then push the changed content out to a destination site, either in an organization's DMZ or at a co-location facility. This chapter describes the content deployment capability in MOSS designed to handle such business requirements.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 18, \"Offline Authoring with Document Converters\"—</b>While MOSS 2007 Publishing sites offer a very robust Web-based content authoring experience, SharePoint provides a way to author content offline using tools such as Microsoft Word or InfoPath. This chapter explains what you need to know about configuring the document converter infrastructure and creating custom document converters.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 19, \"Performance Tips, Tricks, and Traps\"—</b>Internet-facing content-centric sites built on the SharePoint platform need to be designed and developed with performance in mind. This chapter provides numerous guidelines and tips that developers can leverage to create the most performant sites.</p></li><li><p><b>Chapter 20, \"Incorporating ASP.NET 2.0 Applications\"—</b>SharePoint (both WSS 3.0 and MOSS 2007) is not an end-to-end solution but an application platform. While it provides a significant amount of functionality out of the box, developers can leverage this platform in building custom applications. This chapter discusses some techniques that can be used for such tasks.</p></li><p>One approach book takes is not to dwell on the more common minutia of creating projects in Visual Studio, or the huge topics of core Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) 3.0 development or SharePoint administration. These topics warrant their own books, and throughout this book you will find recommended resources for these topics. This book does cover some subjects that have their roots in WSS, but they are presented within the context of a Publishing site.</p><p>Finally, this book approaches every topic of implementation from the perspective of SharePoint customization and SharePoint development. While one implementation may seem to be better than the other, it takes no position on either, as the goal is to simply educate readers about the advantages and disadvantages of each. These concepts are defined in Chapter 2, \"Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 Development Primer.\"</p><p>This book is also available as part of the 4-book SharePoint 2007 Wrox Box (ISBN: 0470431946) with these 4 books:</p><li><p>Professional SharePoint 2007 Development (ISBN: 0470117567)</p></li><li><p>Real World SharePoint 2007 (ISBN: 0470168358)</p></li><li><p>Professional Microsoft SharePoint 2007 Design (ISBN: 047028580X)</p></li><li><p>Professional SharePoint 2007 Web Content Management Development (ISBN: 0470224754)</p></li></span></span></span>",

These individuals are active authors, speakers, bloggers, and innovators. They are also skilled network engineers, developers, trainers, designers, and architects. In the SharePoint community, these MVPs are recognized for their expertise in either Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) or Microsoft Office SharePoint Server (MOSS).</p><p>This book represents the efforts of 16 MVPs in the SharePoint community to present core areas of SharePoint 2007 products and technologies seasoned with significant field experience. The idea behind the book is to lower the learning curve for the reader, while providing the insight necessary to avoid common missteps. This book is an extension of the work the authors have done in their own blogs, books, and presentations.</p><p>This book is for the community of SharePoint professionals. That means that architects, designers, developers, administrators, and engineers all will find something useful in its pages. As a reader, you will want to focus on chapters that appeal to your areas of expertise directly. Some of the chapters, for example, assume a strong programming background, whereas others are centered on administration or maintenance. All readers should have some prior experience with SharePoint 2007 products and technologies to get the most out of this book, although the book does include an introductory chapter for those who are just getting started. The authors generally assume a working knowledge of SharePoint in an effort to focus the discussion on implementation and best practices.</p><p>This book covers SharePoint 2007 products and technologies. Specifically, you will find topics relating to both WSS and MOSS. The topics were selected by SharePoint MVP and Editor Scot Hiller based on the authors' capabilities to represent a cross-section of the most important areas within SharePoint. Although the chapters have been arranged in a logical order, they are intended to stand alone as independent articles.</p><p>Specifically, here's what the book covers:</p><li><p>Introduction to SharePoint by Mike Walsh: an overview of SharePoint</p></li><li><p>Configuring Forms Based Authentication by Stacy Draper: different approaches to FBA, along with their strengths and weaknesses including some custom solutions to problems such as user and role management.</p></li><li><p>Understanding SharePoint Administration by Todd Klindt: the basics (such as backup and recovery), more advanced topics (such as command-line utilities and tips), and techniques for managing site templates.</p></li><p>Developing Publishing Sites the Smart and Structured Way by Andrew Connell: an alternative technique for developing Publishing sites within MOSS discusses development with the SharePoint Designer (SPD), but then challenges the conventional thinking with a new structured approach. Readers will learn new ways to ease the management and maintenance of Publishing sites.</p><p>Using SharePoint Designer 2007 by Dustin Miller: This often-maligned tool can be a powerful part of your SharePoint toolkit.</p><li><p>Customizing and Branding the SharePoint 2007 Interface by Shane Perran and Heather Solomon: One of the first tasks in any SharePoint project is branding the use interface. The reader will learn all of the different ways to customize the look and feel of SharePoint using master pages, style sheets, and graphics.</p></li><li><p>Understanding Web Parts by Jan Tielens: walks the reader through the creation and deployment of Web Parts. Readers should have a strong C# programming background.</p></li><li><p>Creating Workflows in WSS by Robert Bogue: Readers will learn how to create custom workflows and forms for deployment in WSS including many tips and tricks from actual field experience. Readers should have a strong C# programming background.</p></li><li><p>Creating Workflow in SharePoint Server 2007 by Joris Poelmans: The big difference between WSS and MOSS workflows is the ability to use InfoPath forms. This has extensive coverage of InfoPath forms and how to use them with MOSS workflows.</p></li><li><p>Using the Business Data Catalog by Nick Swan: The Business Data Catalog (BDC) is used to allow MOSS to access line-of-business databases. Includes tips to make the development process easier. Readers should be familiar with XML.</p></li><li><p>Using Excel Services by Luis Du Solier Grinda: Excel Services is used to allow MOSS to present spreadsheet data to end users through a browser. This technology is a foundational element in the development of dashboards in the SharePoint Report Center.</p></li><li><p>Securing SharePoint Communication by Adam Buenz: Readers will learn to implement Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Kerberos security, and how to use the Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration (ISA) Server.</p></li><li><p>Using Information Rights Management by Jason Medero: setting up IRM and using it with SharePoint libraries to restrict document functionality (such as printing and attaching) so sensitive information does not leave an organization.</p></li><li><p>Upgrading from SPS 2003 to MOSS 2007 Using the Gradual Method by Shane Young: One of the biggest trends in the SharePoint community is upgrading from SharePoint Portal Server 2003 (SPS 2003) to MOSS. This examines all of the different upgrade approaches, and then walks the reader through the gradual method for upgrading. Contains a wealth of field experience learned from performing many upgrades.</p></li><p>This book is also available as part of the 4-book SharePoint 2007 Wrox Box (ISBN: 0470431946) with these 4 books:</p><li><p>Professional SharePoint 2007 Development (ISBN: 0470117567)</p></li><li><p>Real World SharePoint 2007 (ISBN: 0470168358)</p></li><li><p>Professional Microsoft SharePoint 2007 Design (ISBN: 047028580X)</p></li><li><p>Professional SharePoint 2007 Web Content Management Development (ISBN: 0470224754)</p></li></span></span>",

The wide range of usage scenarios make it difficult for developers to grasp the full ability of this next-generation platform.

Designed to be a quick reference, how-to guide that lets you dive straight into the task at hand, you'll find this book's attention to detail and pragmatism make it an attractive companion during your branding experience.</p><p>SharePoint 2010 deployments are more common than ever, as is the desire to make the environment branded and attractive to both internal and external clients. However, since SharePoint is more than just a collection of web pages, customizing the look and feel and completing the process of branding the platform itself is complex and requires a knowledge of web development, web design techniques, and a familiarity with SharePoint administration—a curious niche, to be sure. And sometimes, you just need to make quick fixes, while at other times, building an entirely customized and branded environment is a multi-step process with lots of stakeholder buy-in and development time required.</p><p>Whether you're interested in applying just a touch of style to a team site, or you're branding a public-facing Fortune 500 website based on SharePoint, <em>Practical SharePoint 2010 Branding and Customization</em> is the only book you'll need to quickly, easily, and efficiently brand and customize your environment.</p><p><b>Bonus:</b><em>Includes the SharePoint 2010 Branding Starter Kit!</em> This kit has everything you need to jumpstart successful and compelling designs. The kit includes a layered Adobe Photoshop file of a SharePoint 2010 site, two pre-built visual design examples, and a Visual Studio solution you can use to deploy either of the designs included. This starter kit is specifically prepared to save you substantial time kicking off your SharePoint branding project and to minimize potential roadblocks. These branding tools would cost you as much as $500 if purchased separately, but they're included with the purchase of this book at no additional charge! Get started today.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>Plan for branding projects, including creating wireframes and creative mockups as well as gathering requirements and estimation</p></li><li><p>Use cascading style sheets (CSS), master pages, page layouts, web parts and XSLT to customize branding</p></li><li><p>Deploy SharePoint branding to production servers using solution packages (WSP)</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for anyone who works within SharePoint sites and wants to make changes to how those sites look, whether they're minor changes or wholesale branding and customization efforts.</p></span></span></span>",

This chapter lays out the foundation for important terminology and concepts explored in the following chapters of the book.</p><p><b>Chapter 2: Working with SharePoint Lists:</b> This chapter introduces one of the core mechanisms for sharing and organizing content in a SharePoint site. You will review what lists are, how they are used, and then explore the various templates that exist in SharePoint.</p><p><b>Chapter 3: Working with SharePoint Libraries:</b> After reviewing some of the fundamental concepts relating to lists, the chapter introduces the other major storage mechanism in SharePoint known as libraries. This chapter discusses some of the various templates that exist for libraries as well as brand-new concepts in 2007, such as slide libraries and wiki page libraries.</p><p><b>Chapter 4: Managing and Customizing Lists and Libraries:</b> SharePoint templates for lists and libraries provide a great starting point for collaboration and information sharing. This chapter introduces how you can extend these base templates to address an organization's specific requirements for a collaborative site or information management tool.</p><p><b>Chapter 5: Working with Workflow:</b> Workflow is a new feature available in SharePoint Server 2007. This chapter discusses the templates that SharePoint provides for workflow, as well as demonstrates how to create a custom workflow solution using the SharePoint Designer.</p><p><b>Chapter 6: Working with Content Types:</b> Most organizations have information and documents, which often utilize consistent templates, processes and policies each time they are created. Therefore, SharePoint 2007 has introduced the concept of a Content Type to allow an organization to package templates and information to ensure that reusable components are rolled out in the organization to enforce consistency and ease of use. This chapter demonstrates what content types are and explores how they can be used through some hands-on examples.</p><p><b>Chapter 7: Working with Web Parts:</b> Web Parts are an important element in SharePoint because they display information in sites to users. A variety of Web Parts exist in SharePoint 2007 to address the many ways that teams want to present information. This chapter explores the various groups of Web Parts in SharePoint, including examples on how specific types of Web Parts can be configured and used to present information in a desired manner.</p><p><b>Chapter 8: Working with Sites and Workspaces:</b> The fundamental components of any SharePoint environment are the sites and workspaces that it contains. These collaborative work areas contain all the components discussed in previous sections and represent how each of those items come together to provide an effective environment for collaboration, communication, and document management. In this section of the book, topics such as site templates, features, and look and feel are covered.</p><p><b>Chapter 9: User Management, Audiences, and Profiles:</b> Effective management of users is of ultimate importance to any information system. The two primary tiers of effective user management include securing content and personalizing information on the portal. This chapter explains in simple terms how to effectively secure a SharePoint environment at the site level, the list or library level, and down to the unique content items stored on a SharePoint site. In addition, an introduction to personalization is presented to ensure that readers understand how to effectively target information to users in a portal.</p><p><b>Chapter 10: Working with Forms Services:</b> InfoPath is the ideal companion to SharePoint for many business solutions. This chapter introduces readers to creating simple business applications using InfoPath and SharePoint including new features in 2007, such as template parts and browser based forms.</p><p><b>Chapter 11: Working with Excel Services:</b> SharePoint addresses the need that many organizations face for better visibility and accessibility to data that is often stored in Excel spreadsheets or external business applications. This chapter demonstrates how to improve the overall decision making of an organization by providing access to important information by utilizing browser based worksheets, visual indicators of performance information, and building personalized interactive dashboards.</p><p><b>Chapter 12: Working with the Business Data Catalog:</b> The Business Data Catalog is completely new to SharePoint in 2007 and offers a fantastic way to access information stored in other business applications through the SharePoint portal interface and elements. This chapter introduces the concept of the Business Data Catalog, explaining each of the key roles in detail and then focusing on usage scenarios from the perspective of the business analyst and end-user roles.</p><p><b>Chapter 13: Getting Started with Web Content Management:</b> All the functionality previously available in Content Management Server 2002 has been incorporated into the SharePoint platform for 2007. This convergence of technology allows for the creation, review, and publishing of web content from a single environment. This chapter provides an overview of the web content management capabilities of the system including the use of publishing sites and features, the automatic provisioning of multilingual content through variations, and user-interface customization.</p><p><b>Chapter 14: Working with Search:</b> An information system is useful to an organization only if stakeholders can easily access and locate the information it contains. This chapter discusses the search engine capabilities of the SharePoint platform including methods that improve the search experience through the use of custom search scopes, content sources, and best bets.</p></span></span></span>",
