			"title": "Spring Boot Persistence Best Practices: Optimize Java Persistence Performance in Spring Boot Applications",
			"description": "<span>This book is a collection of developer code recipes and best practices for persisting data using Spring, particularly Spring Boot. The book is structured around practical recipes, where each recipe discusses a performance case or performance-related case, and almost every recipe has one or more applications. Mainly, when we try to accomplish something (e.g., read some data from the database), there are several approaches to do it, and, in order to choose the best way, you have to know the implied trades-off from a performance perspective. You’ll see that in the end, all these penalties slow down the application. Besides presenting the arguments that favor a certain choice, the application is written in Spring Boot style which is quite different than plain Hibernate.<p></p>\n\nPersistence is an important set of techniques and technologies for accessing and using data, and this book demonstrates that data is mobile regardless of specific applications and contexts. In Java development, persistence is a key factor in enterprise, ecommerce, cloud and other transaction-oriented applications. <p></p><p></p>\n<p>After reading and using this book, you'll have the fundamentals to apply these persistence solutions into your own mission-critical enterprise Java applications that you build using Spring.</p><p></p>\n<p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p>\n<p></p><ul><li>Shape *-to-many associations for best performances</li><li>Effectively exploit Spring Projections (DTO) </li><li>Learn best practices for batching inserts, updates and deletes </li><li>Effectively fetch parent and association in a single SELECT</li><li>Learn how to inspect Persistent Context content</li><li>Dissect pagination techniques (offset and keyset)</li><li>Handle queries, locking, schemas, Hibernate types, and more</li></ul><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p> <p><b>Who This Book Is For</b> </p><p>Any Spring and Spring Boot developer that wants to squeeze the persistence layer performances.</p></span>",

Apps are now developed with APIs that enable ease of integration for the cloud environment and distributed systems. With this Spring book, you'll discover various kinds of production-ready API implementation using REST APIs and explore async using the reactive paradigm, gRPC, and GraphQL.</p><p>You'll learn how to design evolving REST-based APIs supported by HATEOAS and ETAGs and develop reactive, async, non-blocking APIs. After that, you'll see how to secure REST APIs using Spring Security and find out how the APIs that you develop are consumed by the app's UI. The book then takes you through the process of testing, deploying, logging, and monitoring your APIs. You'll also explore API development using gRPC and GraphQL and design modern scalable architecture with microservices. The book helps you gain practical knowledge of modern API implementation using a sample e-commerce app.</p><p>By the end of this Spring book, you'll be able to develop, test, and deploy highly scalable, maintainable, and developer-friendly APIs to help your customers to transform their business.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand RESTful API development, its design paradigm, and its best practices</li><li>Become well versed in Spring's core components for implementing RESTful web services</li><li>Implement reactive APIs and explore async API development</li><li>Apply Spring Security for authentication using JWT and authorization of requests</li><li>Develop a React-based UI to consume APIs</li><li>Implement gRPC inter-service communication</li><li>Design GraphQL-based APIs by understanding workflows and tooling</li><li>Gain insights into how you can secure, test, monitor, and deploy your APIs</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for inexperienced Java programmers, comp science, or coding boot camp graduates who have knowledge of basic programming constructs, data structures, and algorithms in Java but lack the practical web development skills necessary to start working as a developer. Professionals who've recently joined a startup or a company and are tasked with creating real-world web APIs and services will also find this book helpful. This book is also a good resource for Java developers who are looking for a career move into web development to get started with the basics of web service development.</p></span>",

The book starts with topics related to VLAN and routing (static and advanced) and then discusses in full the UTM features integrated in the appliance. The text explains SSL VPN and IPSEC VPN with all the required steps you need to deploy the aforementioned solutions. High availability and troubleshooting techniques are also explained in the last two chapters of the book.</p><p>This concise, example-oriented book explores all the concepts you need to administer a FortiGate unit. You will begin by covering the basic tools required to administer a FortiGate unit, including NAT, routing, and VLANs. You will then be guided through the concepts of firewalling, UTM inside the appliance, tunnelling using SSL, and IPSEC and dial-up configurations. Next, you will get acquainted with important topics like high availability and Vdoms. Finally, you will end the book with an overview of troubleshooting tools and techniques.</p></span>",

At the\nsame time, it will help them gain a deep understanding of the\nfoundations of certificate-based identity management. Its layered\nand modular approach helps readers quickly get the information they\nneed to efficiently plan, design, deploy, manage, or troubleshoot\nany PKI environment. The authors begin by presenting the\nfoundations of PKI, giving readers the theoretical background they\nneed to understand its mechanisms. Next, they move to high-level\ndesign considerations, guiding readers in making the choices most\nsuitable for their own environments. The authors share best\npractices and experiences drawn from production customer\ndeployments of all types. They organize a series of design\n\"modules\" into hierarchical models which are then applied to\ncomprehensive solutions. Readers will be introduced to the use of\nPKI in multiple environments, including Cisco router-based DMVPN,\nASA, and 802.1X. The authors also cover recent innovations such as\nCisco GET VPN. Throughout, troubleshooting sections help ensure\nsmooth deployments and give readers an even deeper \"under-the-hood\"\nunderstanding of their implementations.</p></span>",

To make best use of the code samples included in the book, you should have a basic knowledge of the Java language. Previous experience with the Spring Framework would also help you get up and running quickly.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Deep dive into the principles behind REST</li><li>Expose CRUD operations through RESTful endpoints with the Spring Framework</li><li>Devise response formats and error handling strategies, offering a consistent and flexible structure to simplify integration for service consumers</li><li>Follow the best approaches for dealing with a service's evolution while maintaining backward compatibility</li><li>Understand techniques to secure web services</li><li>Comply with the best ways to test RESTful web services, including tips for load testing</li><li>Optimise and scale web services using techniques such as caching and clustering</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>REST is an architectural style that tackles the challenges of building scalable web services. In today's connected world, APIs have taken a central role on the web. APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become synonymous with APIs.The depth, breadth, and ease of use of Spring makes it one of the most attractive frameworks in the Java ecosystem. Marrying the two technologies is therefore a very natural choice.This book takes you through the design of RESTful web services and leverages the Spring Framework to implement these services. Starting from the basics of the philosophy behind REST, you'll go through the steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. Taking a practical approach, each chapter provides code samples that you can apply to your own circumstances.This second edition brings forth the power of the latest Spring 5.0 release, working with MVC built-in as well as the front end framework. It then goes beyond the use of Spring to explores approaches to tackle resilience, security, and scalability concerns. Improve performance of your applications with the new HTTP 2.0 standards. You'll learn techniques to deal with security in Spring and discover how to implement unit and integration test strategies.Finally, the book ends by walking you through building a Java client for your RESTful web service, along with some scaling techniques using the new Spring Reactive libraries.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Readers will be taken through a set of specific patterns and tested practices to build effective RESTful systems in Java using the Spring framework.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

			"title": "Success Metrics: A Multidimensional Framework for Measuring Organizational Success",
			"description": "<span><p>Learn how to measure success at the individual and organizational levels. By measuring success in multiple dimensions using multivariate methods you will be able to determine what works and what doesn't. The key is to measure and promote progress in terms of organizational vision, mission, and overarching goals.</p><p>Business leaders too often succumb to the working assumption that they only have to show shareholders and boards of trustees that they are turning a profit—the higher the profit, the more successful their stewardship of the company. Wrong! To truly thrive and endure, all organizations—corporate, government, small, large, nonprofit, or startup—need to define and pursue the underlying purpose for their existence.</p><p>To measure success, leaders today are missing a key meta-analytic in their toolbox. In this book, metrics consultant Martin Klubeck provides it to them. <i>Success Metrics</i> steps you through the process of identifying and combining the right measures to gauge, narrate, and guide your organization's progress toward true success. All organizations have a common goal to be successful. All leaders want to make data-informed decisions and use measures to improve processes, communicate progress, and gain support. The problem is that proxy or partial measures don't measure overall success and can be misleading. They measure performance parameters, progress on a specific task, customer feedback, and other piecemeal indices—which taken separately fail to describe an organization's progress toward overall success.</p><p>The author's integrated measures of success can be used to communicate organizational progress to stakeholders, shareholders, boards of trustees, corporate leaders, the workforce, and the customer base and thereby galvanize broad commitment to organizational success. Klubeck shows how his principles and methods of measuring overall success can be applied at all levels: individual, team, group, department, division, and organization.</p><p>What You Will Learn:</p><ul><li><p>Understand why you should measure success instead of performance</p></li><li><p>Understand what to measure and what not to measure</p></li><li><p>Integrate the measures of success to tell a complete story</p></li><li><p>Share measures of success with different audiences</p></li></ul><p>Who This Book Is For</p><p>Organizational leaders at all levels from the executive suite to middle management, analysts and consultants who are tasked with designing metrics programs for organizations, individuals interested in adapting the author's framework to measure overall personal success in multiple dimensions</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Most biometric books are either extraordinarily technical for technophiles or extremely elementary for the lay person. Striking a balance between the two, <strong>Biometric Technology: Authentication, Biocryptography, and Cloud-Based Architecture</strong> is ideal for business, IT, or security managers that are faced with the task of making purchasing, migration, or adoption decisions. It brings biometrics down to an understandable level, so that you can immediately begin to implement the concepts discussed.<br/><br/>Exploring the technological and social implications of widespread biometric use, the book considers the science and technology behind biometrics as well as how it can be made more affordable for small and medium-sized business. It also presents the results of recent research on how the principles of cryptography can make biometrics more secure. <br/><br/>Covering biometric technologies in the cloud, including security and privacy concerns, the book includes a chapter that serves as a \"how-to manual\" on procuring and deploying any type of biometric system. It also includes specific examples and case studies of actual biometric deployments of localized and national implementations in the U.S. and other countries.<br/><br/>The book provides readers with a technical background on the various biometric technologies and how they work. Examining optimal application in various settings and their respective strengths and weaknesses, it considers ease of use, false positives and negatives, and privacy and security issues. It also covers emerging applications such as biocryptography.<br/><br/>Although the text can be understood by just about anybody, it is an ideal resource for corporate-level executives who are considering implementing biometric technologies in their organizations.</p></span></span>",

You are not expected to have any previous experience with Spring Security.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Understand common security vulnerabilities and how to resolve them</li><li>Learn to perform initial penetration testing to uncover common security vulnerabilities</li><li>Implement authentication and authorization</li><li>Learn to utilize existing corporate infrastructure such as LDAP, Active Directory, Kerberos, CAS, OpenID, and OAuth</li><li>Integrate with popular frameworks such as Spring, Spring-Boot, Spring-Data, JSF, Vaaden, jQuery, and AngularJS.</li><li>Gain deep understanding of the security challenges with RESTful webservices and microservice architectures</li><li>Integrate Spring with other security infrastructure components like LDAP, Apache Directory server and SAML</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Knowing that experienced hackers are itching to test your skills makes security one of the most difficult and high-pressured concerns of creating an application. The complexity of properly securing an application is compounded when you must also integrate this factor with existing code, new technologies, and other frameworks. Use this book to easily secure your Java application with the tried and trusted Spring Security framework, a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework.</p><p>The book starts by integrating a variety of authentication mechanisms. It then demonstrates how to properly restrict access to your application. It also covers tips on integrating with some of the more popular web frameworks. An example of how Spring Security defends against session fixation, moves into concurrency control, and how you can utilize session management for administrative functions is also included.</p><p>It concludes with advanced security scenarios for RESTful webservices and microservices, detailing the issues surrounding stateless authentication, and demonstrates a concise, step-by-step approach to solving those issues. And, by the end of the book, readers can rest assured that integrating version 4.2 of Spring Security will be a seamless endeavor from start to finish.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This practical step-by-step tutorial has plenty of example code coupled with the necessary screenshots and clear narration so that grasping content is made easier and quicker.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

Kotlin shares the same pragmatic, innovative and opinionated mindset as Spring, so they work well together. Spring when combined with Kotlin helps you to reach a new level of productivity. This combination has helped developers to create Functional Applications using both the tools together. This book will teach you how to take advantage of these developments and build robust, scalable and reactive applications with ease.</p><p>In this book, you will begin with an introduction to Spring and its setup with Kotlin. You will then dive into assessing the design considerations of your application. Then you will learn to use Spring (with Spring Boot) along with Kotlin to build a robust backend in a microservice architecture with a REST based collaboration, and leverage Project Reactor in your application. You'll then learn how to integrate Spring Data and Spring Cloud to manage configurations for database interaction and cloud deployment. You'll also learn to use Spring Security to beef up security of your application before testing it with the JUnit framework and then deploying it on a cloud platform like AWS.</p>Style and approach<p>Everything you learn will be demonstrated on real-world Spring project. In each chapter we will cover some of Spring features and apply it on our project. We will guide you from the project initialization till the project deployment.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is the easiest and quickest way to achieve such results. Spring is the only Java framework to offer AOP features. The combined power of Spring and AOP gives a powerful and flexible platform to develop and maintain feature-rich web applications quickly.</p><p>This book will help you to write clean, manageable code for your Java applications quickly, utilizing the combined power of Spring and AOP. You will master the concepts of AOP by developing several real-life AOP-based applications with the Spring Framework, implementing the basic components of Spring AOP: Advice, Joinpoint, Pointcut, and Advisor.</p><p>This book will teach you everything you need to know to use AOP with Spring. It starts by explaining the AOP features of Spring and then moves ahead with configuring Spring AOP and using its core classes, with lot of examples. It moves on to explain the AspectJ support in Spring. Then you will develop a three-layered example web application designed with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and built with Test-Driven Development methodology using the full potential of AOP for security, concurrency, caching, and transactions.</p></span>",

This book is a no-nonsense guide with case studies of increasing complexity throughout the book. <em>Pro Spring Boot</em> is written by Felipe Gutierrez, a Spring expert consultant who works with Pivotal, the company behind the Spring Framework.</p><p>Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can almost \"just run\". The goal is to allow you to get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration. Spring Boot provides a radically faster and widely accessible getting started experience for all Spring development and provides a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration); and with absolutely no code generation nor requirements for XML configuration.</p><p>After you read and use this book, you'll be able to develop complex Spring applications and microservices with minimal fuss on things like configurations. This book will let you fully leverage the Spring Boot productivity suite of tools and show you how to apply them through the use of a few case studies as well. </p></span></span>",

The Art of War for Security Managers is the first book to apply the time-honored principles of Sun Tzu's theories of conflict to contemporary organizational security. Corporate leaders have a responsibility to make rational choices that maximize return on investment. The author posits that while conflict is inevitable, it need not be costly. The result is an efficient framework for understanding and dealing with conflict while minimizing costly protracted battles, focusing specifically on the crucial tasks a security manager must carry out in a 21st century organization.</p></span></span>",

Data integration now\naccounts for a major part of the expense and risk of typical data\nwarehousing and business intelligence projects--and, as businesses\nincreasingly rely on analytics, the need for a blueprint for data\nintegration is increasing now more than ever.</p><p>This book presents the solution: a clear,\nconsistent approach to defining, designing, and building data\nintegration components to reduce cost, simplify management, enhance\nquality, and improve effectiveness. Leading IBM data management\nexpert Tony Giordano brings together best practices for\narchitecture, design, and methodology, and shows how to do the\ndisciplined work of getting data integration right.</p><p>Mr. Giordano begins with an overview of the\n“patterns” of data integration, showing how to build\nblueprints that smoothly handle both operational and analytic data\nintegration. Next, he walks through the entire project lifecycle,\nexplaining each phase, activity, task, and deliverable through a\ncomplete case study. Finally, he shows how to integrate data\nintegration with other information management disciplines, from\ndata governance to metadata.

			"title": "Managing Security with Snort & IDS Tools",
			"description": "<span><span><p>Intrusion detection is not for the faint at heart. But, if you are a network administrator chances are you're under increasing pressure to ensure that mission-critical systems are safe--in fact impenetrable--from malicious code, buffer overflows, stealth port scans, SMB probes, OS fingerprinting attempts, CGI attacks, and other network intruders.Designing a reliable way to detect intruders before they get in is a vital but daunting challenge. Because of this, a plethora of complex, sophisticated, and pricy software solutions are now available. In terms of raw power and features, SNORT, the most commonly used Open Source Intrusion Detection System, (IDS) has begun to eclipse many expensive proprietary IDSes. In terms of documentation or ease of use, however, SNORT can seem overwhelming. Which output plugin to use?  How do you to email alerts to yourself? Most importantly, how do you sort through the immense amount of information Snort makes available to you?Many intrusion detection books are long on theory but short on specifics and practical examples. Not <i>Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools</i>.  This new book is a thorough, exceptionally practical guide to managing network security using Snort 2.1 (the latest release) and dozens of other high-quality open source other open source intrusion detection programs.<i>Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools</i> covers reliable methods for detecting network intruders, from using simple packet sniffers to more sophisticated IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) applications and the GUI interfaces for managing them. A comprehensive but concise guide for monitoring illegal entry attempts, this invaluable new book explains how to shut down and secure workstations, servers, firewalls, routers, sensors and other network devices.Step-by-step instructions are provided to quickly get up and running with Snort. Each chapter includes links for the programs discussed, and additional links at the end of the book give administrators access to numerous web sites for additional information and instructional material that will satisfy even the most serious security enthusiasts.<i>Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools</i> maps out a proactive--and effective--approach to keeping your systems safe from attack.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Pro Spring Batch",
			"description": "<span><span><span><span><p>Since its release, Spring Framework has transformed virtually every aspect of Java development including web applications, security, aspect-oriented programming, persistence, and messaging. Spring Batch, one of its newer additions, now brings the same familiar Spring idioms to batch processing. Spring Batch addresses the needs of any batch process, from the complex calculations performed in the biggest financial institutions to simple data migrations that occur with many software development projects.</p><p><em>Pro Spring Batch</em> is intended to answer three questions:</p><ul><li><p><b>What?</b> What is batch processing? What does it entail? What makes it different from the other applications we are developing? What are the challenges inherent in the development of a batch process?</p></li><li><p><b>Why?</b> Why do batch processing? Why can't we just process things as we get them? Why do we do batch processing differently than the web applications that we currently work on?</p></li><li><p><b>How?</b> How to implement a robust, scalable, distributed batch processing system using open-source frameworks</p></li></ul><p><em>Pro Spring Batch</em> gives concrete examples of how each piece of functionality is used and why it would be used in a real-world application. This includes providing tips that the \"school of hard knocks\" has taught author <b>Michael Minella</b> during his experience with Spring Batch. <em>Pro Spring Batch</em> includes examples of I/O options that are not mentioned in the official user's guide, as well as performance tips on things like how to limit the impact of maintaining the state of your jobs.</p><p>The author also walks you through, from end to end, the design and implementation of a batch process based upon a theoretical real-world example. This includes basic project setup, implementation, testing, tuning and scaling for large volumes.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Batch concepts and how they relate to the Spring Batch framework</p></li><li><p>How to use declarative I/O using the Spring Batch readers/writers</p></li><li><p>Data integrity techniques used by Spring Batch, including transactions and job state/restartability</p></li><li><p>How to scale batch jobs via distributed batch processing</p></li><li><p>How to handle testing batch processes (Unit and functional)</p></li></ul><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><ul><li><p>Java developers with Spring experience.</p></li><li><p>Java Architects designing batch solutions</p></li></ul><p>More specifically, this book is intended for those who have a solid foundation in the core Java platform. Batch processing covers a wide spectrum of topics, not all of which are covered in detail in this book. Concepts in Java which the reader should be comfortable with include file I/O, JDBC, and transactions. Given that Spring Batch is a framework built upon the open-source IoC container Spring, which will not be covered in this book, it is expected that the reader will be familiar with its concepts and conventions. With that in mind, the reader is not expected to have any prior exposure to the Spring Batch framework. All concepts related to it will be explained in detail, with working examples.</p></span></span></span></span>",

Generally speaking, the answer is, 'it's intuitive', which is accurate but leaves one wanting to know more. <em>Cutting Rhythms</em> breaks down the definition of intuition to find that, even if rhythmic thinking is intuitive thinking, we can still say more than we 'just know.' <br id=\"CRLF\"/><br id=\"CRLF\"/>This book offers possibilities rather than prescriptions. It presents questions an editor or filmmaker can ask themselves about their work, and a clear and useful vocabulary for working with those questions. <em>Cutting Rhythms</em> makes ideas about rhythm in film editing clear and accessible, so that you can do more than just imitate editing you've seen on TV. With this book you'll develop your own sense of rhythm, refine our rhythmic shaping skills, and increase your creativity--and in so doing, become a better filmmaker.\n</span></span>",

The Spring MVC Framework is designed in such a way that every piece of logic and functionality is highly configurable. This Learning Path aims to make you an expert in designing web applications with Spring MVC 4.</p><p>In our first module, we'll begin with an introduction to the Spring framework. You'll then learn aspect-oriented programming. Packed with real-world examples, you'll get an insight into how you can use Spring Expression Language in your applications to make them easier to manage and maintain.</p><p>In the second module, you'll learn everything you need to build modern Spring-based enterprise web applications. From practical development techniques and useful tools from the wider Spring ecosystem, to the new JEE standards, the impact of JavaScript, and even the Internet of Things, you'll feel confident that you can deploy Spring for an impressive range of creative purposes. </p><p>In the final module, you'll find out how to take advantage of Spring MVC's advanced features - essential if you are to properly master the framework.

			"description": "<span><p>Organizations that are able to integrate their applications and\ndata sources have a distinct competitive advantage: strategic\nutilization of company data and technology for greater efficiency\nand profit. But IT managers attempting integration face daunting\nchallenges--disparate legacy systems; a hodgepodge of hardware,\noperating systems, and networking technology; proprietary packaged\napplications; and more.</p><p>Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) offers a solution to\nthis increasingly urgent business need. It encompasses technologies\nthat enable business processes and data to speak to one another\nacross applications, integrating many individual systems into a\nseamless whole.<em>Enterprise Application Integration</em> provides a\ncomprehensive examination of EAI. You will find an overview of EAI\ngoals and approaches, a review of the technologies that support it,\nand a roadmap to implementing an EAI solution. You will also find\nan in-depth explanation of the four major types of EAI: data-level,\napplication interface-level, method-level, and user\ninterface-level. The book describes in detail the middleware models\nand technologies that support these different approaches,\nincluding:</p><ul><li><p>Application servers, including the use of Enterprise JavaBeans\n(EJB) and ActiveX</p></li><li><p>Message-oriented middleware (MOM) and remote procedure calls\n(RPCs)</p></li><li><p>Distributed objects, looking at CORBA and COM</p></li><li><p>Database-oriented middleware and standards, including ODBC,\nJDBC, and OLE DB</p></li><li><p>Java middleware standards</p></li><li><p>Message brokers</p></li><li><p>New process automation and workflow technology</p></li></ul><p>This practical guide to implementing an EAI solution leads you\nthrough all the major steps, including identifying sources of data,\nbuilding the enterprise metadata model, process integration,\nidentifying application interfaces, mapping information movement,\nselecting and applying the technologies, testing, and maintenance.\nOther key topics include integrating packaged applications such as\nSAP R/3 and PeopleSoft, integrating the supply chain using EAI, the\nrole of XML, and process automation. Comprehensive, practical, and\nclearly written, this essential resource will help anyone involved\nin this important business area understand the nature of EAI, its\ntools and techniques, and how to apply it for a significant\nbusiness advantage.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\n0201615835B04062001</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><h4>How to make simple sense of complex statistics--from the author of <i>Numbers Rule Your World</i></h4><p>We live in a world of Big Data--and it's getting bigger every day. Virtually every choice we make hinges on how someone generates data . . . and how someone else interprets it--whether we realize it or not.</p><p>Where do you send your child for the best education? Big Data. Which airline should you choose to ensure a timely arrival? Big Data. Who will you vote for in the next election? Big Data.</p><p>The problem is, the more data we have, the more difficult it is to interpret it. From world leaders to average citizens, everyone is prone to making critical decisions based on poor data interpretations.</p><p>In <i>Numbersense</i>, expert statistician Kaiser Fung explains when you should accept the conclusions of the Big Data \"experts\"--and when you should say, \"Wait . . . what?\" He delves deeply into a wide range of topics, offering the answers to important questions, such as:</p><ul><li>How does the college ranking system really work?</li><li>Can an obesity measure solve America's biggest healthcare crisis?</li><li>Should you trust current unemployment data issued by the government?</li><li>How do you improve your fantasy sports team?</li><li>Should you worry about businesses that track your data?</li></ul><p>Don't take for granted statements made in the media, by our leaders, or even by your best friend. We're on information overload today, and there's a lot of bad information out there.</p><p><i>Numbersense</i> gives you the insight into how Big Data interpretation works--and how it too often doesn't work. You won't come away with the skills of a professional statistician. But you will have a keen understanding of the data traps even the best statisticians can fall into, and you'll trust the mental alarm that goes off in your head when something just doesn't seem to add up.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>Numbersense</i></b></p><p>\"<i>Numbersense</i> correctly puts the emphasis not on the size of big data, but on the analysis of it. Lots of fun stories, plenty of lessons learned—in short, a great way to acquire your own sense of numbers!\"<br/><b>Thomas H. Davenport, coauthor of <i>Competing on Analytics</i> and President’s Distinguished Professor of IT and Management, Babson College</b></p><p>\"Kaiser’s accessible business book will blow your mind like no other. You’ll be smarter, and you won’t even realize it. Buy. It. Now.\"<br/><b>Avinash Kaushik, Digital Marketing Evangelist, Google, and author, <i>Web Analytics 2.0</i></b></p><p>\"Each story in <i>Numbersense</i> goes deep into what you have to think about before you trust the numbers. Kaiser Fung ably demonstrates that it takes skill and resourcefulness to make the numbers confess their meaning.\"<br/><b>John Sall, Executive Vice President, SAS Institute</b></p><p>\"Kaiser Fung breaks the bad news—a ton more data is no panacea—but then has got your back, revealing the pitfalls of analysis with stimulating stories from the front lines of business, politics, health care, government, and education. The remedy isn’t an advanced degree, nor is it common sense. You need <i>Numbersense.</i>\"<br/><b>Eric Siegel, founder, Predictive Analytics World, and author, <i>Predictive Analytics</i></b></p><p>\"I laughed my way through this superb-useful-fun book and learned and relearned a lot. Highly recommended!\"<br/><b>Tom Peters, author of <i>In Search of Excellence</i></b></p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>The traditional view of information security includes the three cornerstones: \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability; however the author asserts authentication \nis the third keystone. As the field continues to grow in complexity, novices and \nprofessionals need a reliable reference that clearly outlines the essentials.\n<strong>Security without Obscurity: A Guide to Confidentiality, Authentication, \nand Integrity</strong> fills this need.</p><p>Rather than focusing on compliance or policies and procedures, this book takes a \ntop-down approach. It shares the author’s knowledge, insights, and observations \nabout information security based on his experience developing dozens of ISO Technical \nCommittee 68 and ANSI accredited X9 standards. Starting with the fundamentals, it \nprovides an understanding of how to approach information security from the bedrock \nprinciples of confidentiality, integrity, and authentication.</p><p>The text delves beyond the typical cryptographic abstracts of encryption and digital \nsignatures as the fundamental security controls to explain how to implement them \ninto applications, policies, and procedures to meet business and compliance requirements. \nProviding you with a foundation in cryptography, it keeps things simple regarding \nsymmetric versus asymmetric cryptography, and only refers to algorithms in general, \nwithout going too deeply into complex mathematics.</p><p>Presenting comprehensive and in-depth coverage of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, \nnon-repudiation, privacy, and key management, this book supplies authoritative insight \ninto the commonalities and differences of various users, providers, and regulators \nin the U.S. and abroad.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>The interpersonal relationships that make up family life are a complex web between many individuals spanning several generations at one time. This web is further complicated by the influence of other factors such as culture and gender. It can be a daunting task for a therapist to unravel this tangle and understand the specific dynamics and individual development within the family. The Multifocused Family Genogram (MFG) is a powerful tool that allows the therapist to record and structure these different elements that make up the family system. By combining the Basic Genogram, the Family Map, and several Focused Genograms, the MFG provides a clear picture of dynamic family history that aids in individual and family assessment.</p><p><em>Focused Genograms</em> provides a thorough account of the use of MFGs in family therapy and practice. The authors present a clinically useful method for collecting the information in key areas of individual and family functioning needed to create Focused Genograms. In addition, the authors carefully explain the diagnostic use and therapeutic applications of this tool. The book is supplemented by extensive examples of Focused Genograms, Family Maps, and Time Lines used in MFG construction. Suggested readings listed at the close of each chapter provide links between techniques fully described in the book and other therapeutic techniques beyond the scope of this work. A thorough presentation of innovative methods for using Focused Genograms makes this an important text for students of marriage and family therapy, as well as an indispensible resource for professionals.</p></span></span>",

Hackers have</p><p>relied on fuzzing for years: Now, it’s\nyour turn. In this book, renowned fuzzing experts show you how to\nuse fuzzing to reveal weaknesses in your software before someone\nelse does.</p><p><em>Fuzzing</em> is the first and only book to\ncover fuzzing from start to finish, bringing disciplined best\npractices to a technique that has traditionally been implemented\ninformally. The authors begin by reviewing how fuzzing works and\noutlining its crucial advantages over other security testing\nmethods. Next, they introduce state-of-the-art fuzzing techniques\nfor finding vulnerabilities in network protocols, file formats, and\nweb applications; demonstrate the use of automated fuzzing tools;\nand present several insightful case histories showing fuzzing at\nwork. Coverage includes:</p><p>• Why fuzzing simplifies test design\nand catches flaws other methods miss</p><p>• The fuzzing process: from\nidentifying inputs to assessing “exploitability”</p><p>• Understanding the requirements for\neffective fuzzing</p><p>• Comparing mutation-based and\ngeneration-based fuzzers</p><p>• Using and automating environment\nvariable and argument fuzzing</p><p>• Mastering in-memory fuzzing\ntechniques</p><p>• Constructing custom fuzzing\nframeworks and tools</p><p>• Implementing intelligent fault\ndetection</p><p>Attackers are already using fuzzing.

Prepare with confidence for the Pivotal Enterprise Integration with Spring Exam.</p><p>One of the important aspects of this book is a focus on new and modern abstractions provided by Spring. Therefore most of the features are shown with Java annotations alongside established XML configurations. Most of the examples in the book are also based on the Spring Boot framework. Spring Boot adoption is exponential because of its capability to significantly simplify Spring configuration using sensible opinionated defaults. But Spring Boot is not the target of the exam, therefore all the features are also covered with plain Spring configuration examples.</p></span></span></span>",

It is not just the primary separation of database, business logic and interface components, but includes a wide range of considerations for building high-performing, scalable and secure applications.</p><p>Deciding which MVC framework best suits the project you are about to begin is one of the biggest challenges you'll face as a developer. If you are part of a team, this decision has probably already been made for you; but in any event, you'll need to know how (and why) the framework authors made it work the way it does.</p><p><em>Pro PHP MVC</em> looks at the building blocks that make any good MVC framework, and how they apply to PHP. It exposes all considerations that many developers take for granted when using a popular framework, and teaches you how to make the framework your own.</p><p>Over the course of reading this book, you will learn the theoretical implications of the choices you would make when writing your own MVC framework, and how to put the pieces together in a cohesive package. We take a look at the highly modular Zend Framework—how to use its collection of loosely coupled classes to build a unified system. We also look at CakePHP, learning from its automated build system (Bakery) and highly intuitive approach to rapid development. This book will lay bare all the secret parts of MVC for you.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>The best way to structure your application files</p></li><li><p>How to get from a URL to the right controller/action</p></li><li><p>Cleanly interact with data objects</p></li><li><p>Efficient use of server resources in content delivery</p></li><li><p>Useful shared class libraries to speed up development</p></li><li><p>Unit testing to ensure maximum stability</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for beginners and advanced developers alike, requiring a basic understanding of PHP5 language features and SQL. If you want to improve your PHP skills, or share the wisdom of popular PHP MVC frameworks, this book will be invaluable to you.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Clustering remains a vibrant area of research in statistics. Although there are many books on this topic, there are relatively few that are well founded in the theoretical aspects. In <b>Robust Cluster Analysis and Variable Selection</b>, Gunter Ritter presents an overview of the theory and applications of probabilistic clustering and variable selection, synthesizing the key research results of the last 50 years. </p><p/><p>The author focuses on the robust clustering methods he found to be the most useful on simulated data and real-time applications. The book provides clear guidance for the varying needs of both applications, describing scenarios in which accuracy and speed are the primary goals.</p><p/><b>\n</b><p>Robust Cluster Analysis and Variable Selection includes all of the important theoretical details, and covers the key probabilistic models, robustness issues, optimization algorithms, validation techniques, and variable selection methods. The book illustrates the different methods with simulated data and applies them to real-world data sets that can be easily downloaded from the web. This provides you with guidance in how to use clustering methods as well as applicable procedures and algorithms without having to understand their probabilistic fundamentals.</p></span></span>",

As an instructor teaching a master’s-level course on microwave measurements, the author<strong> </strong>recognized that few of today’s graduate electrical engineering students are knowledgeable about microwave measurements beyond basic distributed circuit analysis. Written in a \"how-it-works\" spirit—strongly borrowing from instrument catalogs and application notes—this text covers a wide range of topics, clarifies many terms used widely on the subject, and equips the reader with the ability to grasp more advanced material.\n<p/>\n<p>It starts with a brief overview of the basic theory and the building blocks required for understanding and using microwave measurement techniques. Oriented around the most commonly used instruments in microwave measurements—the network analyzer, the spectrum analyzer, and synthesized microwave source—it introduces the latest instruments and techniques and provides a brief description of traditional measurement techniques (slotted waveguide etc.). </p>\n<p/>\n<p>It offers an introduction to the mathematical basis behind microwave measurements as well as an overview of some of the practical components that are frequently used in microwave instruments. Observing that students generally grasp the subject better when actual numbers are given, rather than symbolic relations, the author includes examples involving numerical values that are scattered throughout the book. He also provides a detailed description of the vector network analyzer and the spectrum analyzer (explaining its principle of operation and calibration), which form the backbone of modern microwave measurements. In addition, he briefly addresses advanced topics such as pulsed measurements and non-linear network analysis. </p>\n<p/>\n<p>Comprised of ten chapters, this text:</p>\n<p/>\n<ul><p>\n</p><li>Discusses noise measurement and synthesized signal generation </li><li>Provides an overview of RF wafer-probing and modern microwave oscilloscopes—relatively advanced topics</li><li>Contains detailed derivations and exercises</li><p/></ul><p/><strong><p>An Introduction to Microwave Measurements</p></strong> provides proficiency in subjects related to radio frequency (RF) and microwave systems, and is an ideal resource for senior undergraduate and first-year master’s-level students as well as professionals in the wireless industry who deal with such systems but are not specialists in the area.\n<p/></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Although batch processing has existed for a long time, designing these processes and unit operations has been considered an onerous task that required computational efforts. Design of these processes is made more complex because of the time dependent nature of the process and the allowable flexibility. More often than not, every unit encounters optimal control problems. Therefore, traditional design books have not covered batch processing in detail. Filling this void, <b>Batch Processing: Modeling and Design</b> describes various unit operations in batch and bio-processing as well as design methods for these units.</p><p>Topics include:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Batch distillation operating modes and configurations </li><li>Batch absorption operations based on the solubility difference</li><li>Batch adsorption based on differential affinity of various soluble molecules to solid absorbents</li><li>Batch chromatography for measuring a wide variety of thermodynamic, kinetic, and physico-chemical properties</li><li>Batch crystallization where a phase is used to find the supersaturation at which point material crystallizes</li><li>Batch drying that stresses the phase diagram of water to describe this operation</li><li>Batch filtration using a porous medium or screen to separate solids from liquids</li><li>Batch centrifugation where centrifugal force is used for separation</li><p/></ul><p/><p>Batch processes are widely used in pharmaceutical, food, and specialty chemicals where high value, low volume products are manufactured. Recent developments in bio-based manufacturing also favor batch processes because feed variations can be easily handled in batch processes. Further, the emerging area of nanomaterials manufacturing currently uses batch processes as they are low volume, high energy intensive processes. With examples, case studies, and more than 100 homework problems, this book describes the unit operations in batch and bioprocessing and gives students a thorough grounding in the numerical methods necessary to solve these design problems.</p></span>",

			"title": "Understanding the Tensile Properties of Concrete",
			"description": "<span>The response of concrete under tensile loading is crucial for most applications because concrete is much weaker in tension than in compression. Understanding the response mechanisms of concrete under tensile conditions is therefore key to understanding and using concrete in structural applications. Understanding the tensile properties of concrete summarises key recent research in this important subject.<br/><br/>After an introduction to concrete, the book is divided into two parts: part one on static response and part two on dynamic response. Part one starts with a summary chapter on the most important parameters that affect the tensile response of concrete. Chapters show how multi scale modelling is used to relate concrete composition to tensile properties. Part two focuses on dynamic response and starts with an introduction to the different regimes of dynamic loading, ranging from the low frequency loading by wind or earthquakes up to the extreme dynamic conditions due to explosions and ballistic impacts. Following chapters review dynamic testing techniques and devices that deal with the various regimes of dynamic loading. Later chapters highlight the dynamic behaviour of concrete from different viewpoints, and the book ends with a chapter on practical examples of how detailed knowledge on tensile properties is used by engineers in structural applications.<br/><br/>Drawing on the work of some of the leading experts in the field, Understanding the tensile properties of concrete is a valuable reference for civil and structural engineers as well as those researching this important material.<br/><br/><ul><li>Summarises key recent research in the areas of understanding the response mechanisms of concrete under tensile conditions</li><li>Provides a summary of the most important parameters that affect the tensile response of concrete and shows how multi scale modeling is used to relate concrete composition to tensile properties</li><li>Highlights the dynamic behaviour of concrete from different viewpoints and provides practical examples of how detailed knowledge on tensile properties is used by engineers in structural applications</li></ul></span>",

			"title": "Discrete Wavelet Transformations: An Elementary Approach with Applications",
			"description": "<span><span><p>An \"applications first\" approach to discrete wavelet transformations</p><p>Discrete Wavelet Transformations provides readers with a broad elementary introduction to discrete wavelet transformations and their applications. With extensive graphical displays, this self-contained book integrates concepts from calculus and linear algebra into the construction of wavelet transformations and their various applications, including data compression, edge detection in images, and signal and image denoising.</p><p>The book begins with a cursory look at wavelet transformation development and illustrates its allure in digital signal and image applications. Next, a chapter on digital image basics, quantitative and qualitative measures, and Huffman coding equips readers with the tools necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the applications. Subsequent chapters discuss the Fourier series, convolution, and filtering, as well as the Haar wavelet transform to introduce image compression and image edge detection. The development of Daubechies filtersis presented in addition to coverage of wavelet shrinkage in the area of image and signal denoising. The book concludes with the construction of biorthogonal filters and also describes their incorporation in the JPEG2000 image compression standard.</p><p>The author's \"applications first\" approach promotes a hands-on treatment of wavelet transforma-tion construction, and over 400 exercises are presented in a multi-part format that guide readers through the solution to each problem. Over sixty computer labs and software development projects provide opportunities for readers to write modules and experiment with the ideas discussed throughout the text. The author's software package, DiscreteWavelets, is used to perform various imaging and audio tasks, compute wavelet transformations and inverses, and visualize the output of the computations. Supplementary material is also available via the book's related Web site, which includes an audio and video repository, final project modules, and softwarefor reproducing examples from the book. All software, including the DiscreteWavelets package, is available for use with Mathematica®, MATLAB®, and Maple.</p><p>Discrete Wavelet Transformations strongly reinforces the use of mathematics in digital data applications, sharpens programming skills, and provides a foundation for further study of more advanced topics, such as real analysis. This book is ideal for courses on discrete wavelet transforms and their applications at the undergraduate level and also serves as an excellent reference for mathematicians, engineers, and scientists who wish to learn about discrete wavelet transforms at an elementary level.</p></span></span>",

It's disposable, but it can last for centuries. Its surface can be rough, or creamy smooth, or shiny. Sometimes it's so thin you can see through it; other times, it's thick enough to hold globs of paint. But it can also be beautiful, all on its own.</p><p>The projects in Paper Inventions were inspired by the many different varieties of paper, from fancy artists' watercolor paper to recycled copy paper, and the many different ways it is used.

The solution is\nvisualization. Using today’s state-of-the-art data\nvisualization techniques, you can gain a far deeper understanding\nof what’s happening on your network right now. You can\nuncover hidden patterns of data, identify emerging vulnerabilities\nand attacks, and respond decisively with countermeasures that are\nfar more likely to succeed than conventional methods.</p><p>In <em>Applied Security Visualization</em>,\nleading network security visualization expert Raffael Marty\nintroduces all the concepts, techniques, and tools you need to use\nvisualization on your network. You’ll learn how to identify\nand utilize the right data sources, then transform your data into\nvisuals that reveal what you really need to know. Next, Marty shows\nhow to use visualization to perform broad network security\nanalyses, assess specific threats, and even improve business\ncompliance.</p><p>He concludes with an introduction to a broad\nset of visualization tools. The book’s CD also includes\nDAVIX, a compilation of freely available tools for security\nvisualization.</p><p>You'll learn how to:</p><p>• Intimately understand the data\nsources that are essential for effective visualization</p><p>• Choose the most appropriate graphs\nand techniques for your IT data</p><p>• Transform complex data into\ncrystal-clear visual representations</p><p>• Iterate your graphs to deliver even\nbetter insight for taking action</p><p>• Assess threats to your network\nperimeter, as well as threats imposed by insiders</p><p>• Use visualization to manage risks\nand compliance mandates more successfully</p><p>• Visually audit both the technical\nand organizational aspects of information and network security</p><p>• Compare and master today’s\nmost useful tools for security visualization</p><p>Contains the live CD Data Analysis and\nVisualization Linux (DAVIX).

			"description": "<span><p>\nThere are dozens of Java frameworks out there, but most of them\nrequire you to learn special coding techniques and new, often\nrigid, patterns of development. Wicket is different. As a\ncomponent-based Web application framework, Wicket lets you build\nmaintainable enterprise-grade web applications using the power of\nplain old Java objects (POJOs), HTML, Ajax, Spring, Hibernate and\nMaven. Wicket automatically manages state at the component level,\nwhich means no more awkward HTTPSession objects. Its elegant\nprogramming model enables you to write rich web applications\nquickly.\n<b>Wicket in Action</b> is an authoritative, comprehensive guide\nfor Java developers building Wicket-based Web applications. This\nbook starts with an introduction to Wicket's structure and\ncomponents, and moves quickly into examples of Wicket at work.\nWritten by two of the project's earliest and most authoritative\nexperts, this book shows you both the \"how-to\" and the \"why\" of\nWicket. As you move through the book, you'll learn to use and\ncustomize Wicket components, how to interact with other\ntechnologies like Spring and Hibernate, and how to build rich,\nAjax-driven features into your applications.\n</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>A hands-on guide to building an enterprise-grade, scalable RESTful web service using the Spring Framework</b></p><p><b>About This Book</b></p><ul><li>Follow best practices and explore techniques such as clustering and caching to achieve a scalable web service</li><li>Leverage the Spring Framework to quickly implement RESTful endpoints</li><li>Learn to implement a client library for a RESTful web service using the Spring Framework</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>This book is intended for those who want to learn to build RESTful web services with the Spring Framework. To make best use of the code samples included in the book, you should have a basic knowledge of the Java language. Previous experience with the Spring Framework would also help you get up and running quickly.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Deep dive into the principles behind REST</li><li>Expose CRUD operations through RESTful endpoints with the Spring Framework</li><li>Devise response formats and error handling strategies, offering a consistent and flexible structure to simplify integration for service consumers</li><li>Follow the best approaches for dealing with a service's evolution while maintaining backward compatibility</li><li>Understand techniques to secure web services</li><li>Comply with the best ways to test RESTful web services, including tips for load testing</li><li>Optimise and scale web services using techniques such as caching and clustering</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>REST is an architectural style that tackles the challenges of building scalable web services. In today's connected world, APIs have taken a central role on the web. APIs provide the fabric through which systems interact, and REST has become synonymous with APIs.</p><p>The depth, breadth, and ease of use of Spring makes it one of the most attractive frameworks in the Java ecosystem. Marrying the two technologies is therefore a very natural choice.</p><p>This book takes you through the design of RESTful web services and leverages the Spring Framework to implement these services. Starting from the basics of the philosophy behind REST, you'll go through the steps of designing and implementing an enterprise-grade RESTful web service. Taking a practical approach, each chapter provides code samples that you can apply to your own circumstances.</p><p>This book goes beyond the use of Spring and explores approaches to tackle resilience, security, and scalability concerns. You'll learn techniques to deal with security in Spring and discover how to implement unit and integration test strategies.</p><p>Finally, the book ends by walking you through building a Java client for your RESTful web service, along with some scaling techniques for it.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book is a step-by-step, hands-on guide to designing and building RESTful web services. The book follows the natural cycle of developing these services and includes multiple code samples to help you.</p></span>",

Its purpose is to allow Unix developers to build and\ndeploy cross-platform .NET applications. The project has also\nsparked interest in developing components, libraries and frameworks\nwith C#, the programming language of .NET. The controversy? Some\nsay Mono will become the preferred platform for Linux development,\nempowering Linux/Unix developers. Others say it will allow\nMicrosoft to embrace, extend, and extinguish Linux. The controversy\nrages on, but--like many developers--maybe you've had enough talk\nand want to see what Mono is really all about. There's one way to\nfind out: roll up your sleeves, get to work, and see what you Mono\ncan do. How do you start? You can research Mono at length. You can\nplay around with it, hoping to figure things out for yourself. Or,\nyou can get straight to work with <em>Mono: A Developer's\nNotebook</em>--a hands-on guide and your trusty lab partner as you\nexplore Mono 1.0. Light on theory and long on practical\napplication, <em>Mono: A Developer's Notebook</em> bypasses the talk\nand theory, and jumps right into Mono 1.0. Diving quickly into a\nrapid tour of Mono, you'll work through nearly fifty mini-projects\nthat will introduce you to the most important and compelling\naspects of the 1.0 release. Using the task-oriented format of this\nnew series, you'll learn how to acquire, install, and run Mono on\nLinux, Windows, or Mac OS X. You'll work with the various Mono\ncomponents: Gtk#, the Common Language Runtime, the class libraries\n(both .NET and Mono-provided class libraries), IKVM and the Mono C#\ncompiler. No other resource will take you so deeply into Mono so\nquickly or show you as effectively what Mono is capable of. The new\nDeveloper's Notebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new\ntools for software developers. Emphasizing example over explanation\nand practice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll\nget the goods straight from the masters, in an informal and\ncode-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious\nabout Mono, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff,\nlab-style guide is the solution.\n</p></span>",

If Ajax\napplications aren’t designed and coded properly, they can be\nsusceptible to far more dangerous security vulnerabilities than\nconventional Web or desktop software. Ajax developers desperately\nneed guidance on securing their applications: knowledge\nthat’s been virtually impossible to find, <em>until\nnow</em>.</p><p>\n           \n<em>Ajax Security</em> systematically debunks today’s most\ndangerous myths about Ajax security, illustrating key points with\ndetailed case studies of actual exploited Ajax vulnerabilities,\nranging from MySpace’s Samy worm to MacWorld’s\nconference code validator.

			"title": "Citizen Capitalism",
			"description": "<span>\n    Corporations have a huge influence on the life of every citizen—this book offers a visionary but practical plan to give every citizen a say in how corporations are run while also gaining some supplemental income. It lays out a clear approach that uses the mechanisms of the private market to hold corporations accountable to the public. <br/><br/>This would happen through the creation of what the authors call the Universal Fund, a kind of national, democratic, mega mutual fund. Every American over eighteen would be entitled to a share and would participate in directing its share voting choices. Corporations and wealthy individuals would donate stocks, bonds, cash, or other assets to the fund just like they do to other philanthropic ventures now. The fund would pay out dividends to its citizen-shareholders that would grow as the fund grows. <br/><br/>The Universal Fund is undoubtedly a big idea, but it is also eminently practical: it uses the tools of capitalism, not government, to give all citizens a direct influence on corporate actions. It would be a major institutional investor beholden not to a small elite group of stockholders pushing for short-term gain but to everyone. The fund would reward corporations that made sure their actions didn't harm people, communities, and the environment, and it would enable them to invest in innovations that would take more than a few months to pay off. Which is another reason corporations would donate to the fund—they could be freed from the constant pressure to maximize their quarterly share price and would essentially be subsidized for doing good. <br/><br/>The authors demonstrate that our current economic rules force corporations to be shortsighted and even destructive because for most large investors, nothing matters but share price. The Universal Fund is designed to be a powerful positive balancing force, making the world a better place and the United States a better nation.\n  </span>",

It\ndoesn't make the mistake that other books do: it isn't about\nscripting this or that particular application, and it doesn't\nassume that learning AppleScript is easy or obvious. Instead, the\nbook teaches and documents the language in a clear and rigorous\nmanner, just as you'd expect with any programming or scripting\nlanguage. AppleScript is a dynamic, object-oriented scripting\nsystem that allows Mac users--even novices who know nothing about\nprogramming--to directly control Macintosh applications, including\nthe Mac OS itself. You can write scripts to automate repetitive\ntasks, customize applications, and even control complex workflows.\nAppleScript has always been useful, but with Mac OS X it's even\nmore so. Nearly every application that comes with Mac OS X is\nscriptable. Even non-scriptable applications can often be driven\nwith AppleScript, thanks to the new Accessibility API and GUI\nScripting technologies. And now AppleScripters can put a true Aqua\ninterface around their scripts! There's never been a more exciting\ntime for AppleScript users. <em>AppleScript: The Definitive\nGuide</em> explores and teaches the language from the ground up. If\nyou're a beginner and want to learn how to write your first script\nor just understand what the excitement is all about, you'll be able\nto do so after reading this book. <em>AppleScript: The Definitive\nGuide</em> is the quintessential guide to this important Mac tool.\nRegardless of their level of experience, AppleScripters everywhere\nwill turn to this book again and again.\n</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The transformation from traditional war between nation-states to conflict between nation-states and nonstate actors requires decision makers, policy analysts, military commanders, intelligence officials, and legislators to answer the question: is there a strategy for an unwinnable conflict? This question takes on particular urgency given the extraordinary number of conflict points that define the current state of international relations.<br/><br/><strong>Modern Geopolitics and Security: Strategies for Unwinnable Conflicts </strong>draws on the author's extensive experience in counterterrorism, negotiation, and the implementation of the Oslo Peace Process with his more recent work in academia. The book uses an interdisciplinary case study model to illustrate valuable lessons learned and best practices in strategic analysis and decision making that are based on international relations, international law, and negotiation/intervention.<br/><br/>The book defines sovereignty, intervention, geopolitics, security, and what they mean in a global landscape. It examines historical examples of global crises and security concerns as well as contemporary geopolitical issues, including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, intervention in Libya, non-intervention in Syria, the Good Friday Agreement, the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, and the Arab Spring.<br/><br/>We are entering a new era, where disaffected individuals who are willing and able to act, have more power and potential influence than ever before. Conflicts like those occurring in Egypt, Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Israel, and elsewhere are all complex organisms—nuanced as never before. Add in increasing regional asymmetrical conflicts, increasing global economic strain, social media and the accelerating speed of communication, ideological and regional state versus nonstate conflicts—such as in the case of al-Qaeda and other such movements—and traditional \"business as usual\" geopolitics is being somewhat turned on its head. <br/><br/><strong>Modern Geopolitics and Security</strong> addresses topics that aren’t currently covered anywhere–establishing a new paradigm to rethink modern geopolitics, given new and emerging challenges to traditional schools of thought.</p>\nView an article by Amos N.

			"title": "Spring: A Developer's Notebook",
			"description": "<span><div><p>Since development first began on Spring in 2003, there's been a constant buzz about it in Java development publications and corporate IT departments.  The reason is clear: Spring is a lightweight Java framework in a world of complex heavyweight architectures that take forever to implement. Spring is like a breath of fresh air to overworked developers.In Spring, you can make an object secure, remote, or transactional, with a couple of lines of configuration instead of embedded code. The resulting application is simple and clean. In Spring, you can work less and go home early, because you can strip away a whole lot of the redundant code that you tend to see in most J2EE applications. You won't be nearly as burdened with meaningless detail. In Spring, you can change your mind without the consequences bleeding through your entire application. You'll adapt much more quickly than you ever could before.<i>Spring: A Developer's Notebook</i> offers a quick dive into the new Spring framework, designed to let you get hands-on as quickly as you like. If you don't want to bother with a lot of theory, this book is definitely for you.  You'll work through one example after another. Along the way, you'll discover the energy and promise of the Spring framework.This practical guide features ten code-intensive labs that'll rapidly get you up to speed.  You'll learn how to do the following, and more:</p><ul><li>install the Spring Framework</li><li>set up the development environment</li><li>use Spring with other open source Java tools such as Tomcat, Struts, and Hibernate</li><li>master AOP and transactions</li><li>utilize ORM solutions</li></ul>As with all titles in the Developer's Notebook series, this no-nonsense book skips all the boring prose and cuts right to the chase.  It's an approach that forces you to get your hands dirty by working through one instructional example after another-examples that speak to you instead of at you.</div></span>",

The use of the solid elements of the periodic table, together with thousands of complex solid-state samples, largely extends the range of materials employed in plasma harmonics in contrast to the few light rare gases that are typically used. Thus the exploration of practically any available solid-state material through nonlinear spectroscopy comprising laser ablation and harmonic generation can be considered a new tool for materials science. Plasma harmonic spectroscopy exploits the spectral and structural properties of various ablated solid-state materials by propagating short laser pulses through laser-produced plasma and generating high-order harmonics of ultrashort laser pulses.</p><p/><p>The book describes the special features of plasma harmonics in laser-produced ablation plumes and discusses a wide range of nonlinear medium characteristics that can be produced by varying the conditions of laser plume production on the surface of a solid. </p><p>This book compiles and details cutting-edge research in science and medicine from the interdisciplinary team of the Michigan Nanotechnology Institute for Medicine and Biological Sciences, who are currently revolutionizing drug delivery techniques through the development of engineered nanodevices.

I call that a winning strategy.”<br/><b>—Daniel H. Pink, author of <i>Drive</i> and <i>A Whole New Mind</i></b></p><p>“Want to change your customers’ buying habits? Want to change the world? Stop marketing, read this book, roll up your sleeves, and start a movement.”<br/><b>—Sally Hogshead, author of <i>Fascinate</i> and creator of HowToFascinate.com</b></p><p>“Essential stuff. One of the smartest thinkers on branding on one of the most important developments in that critical intersection between culture and marketing.”<br/><b>—Adam Morgan, author of <i>Eating the Big Fish</i> and <i>The Pirate Inside</i></b></p><p>“A well-researched and insightful book that will hopefully spark a movement against traditional, stodgy marketing. A must-read for the new generation of marketers who will be defining tomorrow’s marketing landscape.”<br/><b>—Boutros Boutros, Senior Vice President, Emirates Airline</b></p><p><b>About the Book:</b></p><p>Movement marketing is changing the world. It’s the new way forward for anyone trying to win customers’ loyalty, influence public opinion, and even change the world. In Uprising, Scott Goodson, founder and CEO of StrawberryFrog, the world’s first cultural movement agency, shows how your idea or organization can successfully ride this wave of cultural movements to authentically connect to the lives and passions of people everywhere.</p><p>We are in the midst of a profound cultural transformation in which technology is making it easier than ever for anyone to share ideas, goals, and interests. Working with companies and brands ranging from SmartCar to Pampers to Jim Beam to India’s Mahindra Group, StrawberryFrog and Goodson have led a paradigm focal shift away from one-on-one selling to sharing.</p><p>Using client case studies and contributions from a global team of movement marketing forerunners—among them, political guru Mark McKinnon; Lee Clow, creative chief at TBWA/Chiat/Day; Apple evangelist Guy Kawasaki; and Marty Cooke, who helped make yellow LIVESTRONG bracelets synonymous with the fight against cancer—Goodson details why and how individuals and companies are embracing the movement phenomenon. He then applies these insights to practical steps that you can take right now to reach people through what matters most to them, including:</p><ul><li>Stop talking about yourself—let the movement control your message</li><li>Home in on the core objectives of your concept or brand—and align these values with what people are for (or against)</li><li>“Light the spark”—create a culture within your organization that can embrace and drive a movement</li><li>Leverage your assets—content, events, expertise, connecting platforms—to give people tools to spread your gospel</li><li>Adjust concepts to travel across borders and link people across cultural boundaries</li></ul><p>The examples and guidance in this book will prepare you to find, connect to, and even lead the next big movement. What happens next is up to you. Get up. Go out. And create a brand <i>Uprising</i> of your own.</p></span></span>",

Security lapses and failures are not simply disruptions—they can be catastrophic events, and the consequences can be felt across the entire organization. As a result, security administrators face serious challenges in protecting the company’s sensitive data. IT staff are challenged to provide detailed audit and controls documentation at a time when they are already facing increasing demands on their time, due to events such as mergers, reorganizations, and other changes. Many organizations do not have enough experienced mainframe security administrators to meet these objectives, and expanding employee skillsets with low-level mainframe security technologies can be time-consuming.</p><p>The IBM® Security zSecure suite consists of multiple components designed to help you administer your mainframe security server, monitor for threats, audit usage and configurations, and enforce policy compliance.

			"title": "Zend Framework in Action",
			"description": "<span><p>\nFrom rather humble beginnings as the Personal Home Page\nscripting language, PHP has found its way into almost every server,\ncorporation, and dev shop in the world. On an average day,\nsomewhere between 500,000 and 2 million coders do something in PHP.\nEven when you use a well-understood language like PHP, building a\nmodern web application requires tools that decrease development\ntime and cost while improving code quality. Frameworks such as\nRuby-on-Rails and Django have been getting a lot of attention as a\nresult.\nFor PHP coders, the Zend Framework offers that same promise\nwithout the need to move away from PHP. This powerful collection of\ncomponents can be used in part or as a whole to speed up the\ndevelopment process. Zend Framework has the backing of Zend\nTechnologies; the driving force behind the PHP programming language\nin which it is written. The first production release of the Zend\nFramework became available in July of 2007.\n<em>Zend Framework in Action</em> is a comprehensive tutorial that\nshows how to use the Zend Framework to create web-based\napplications and web services. This book takes you on an\nover-the-shoulder tour of the components of the Zend Framework as\nyou build a high quality, real-world web application. This book is\norganized around the techniques you'll use every day as a web\ndeveloper \"data handling, forms, authentication, and so forth. As\nyou follow the running example, you'll learn to build interactive\nAjax-driven features into your application without sacrificing\nnuts-and-bolts considerations like security and performance.\nThis book is aimed at the competent PHP developer who wants to\nmaster framework-driven web development. Zend Framework in Action\ngoes beyond the docs but still provides quick access to the most\ncommon topics encountered in the development of web\napplications.\n</p></span>",

By developing custom apps and features on the Yammer platform, you can make your workplace more productive, encourage communication and feedback, and get your colleagues collaborating across a range of platforms, including SharePoint, ASP.NET, and Windows Phone.</p><p>The book begins with an introduction to the development options available along with guidance on how to set up a Yammer developer account. You’ll then take your first step in Yammer integration by building a Yammer feed into a web page or other JavaScript-based client application, before diving into app creation and management on the Yammer platform. </p><p>The authors provide a deep dive into the Yammer authorization process from client-side and server-side perspectives, and you’ll find out how to work closely with Yammer’s data streams and its full range of development possibilities using Open Graph and Yammer’s REST API. The final chapters cover how to build Yammer integration into standalone applications for SharePoint and Windows Phone 8 with Yammer SDKs.</p><p>All chapters are illustrated with examples and sample code, and a case study follows the development of a workplace training application as the authors apply each technique, so you can see how to make the most of what Yammer has to offer.</p></span></span>",

This book focuses on the national securities of a number of South Asian countries in order to discuss a range of issues related to South Asian security.</p><p>The book makes a distinction between traditional and non-traditional security. While state-centric approaches such as bilateral relations between India and Pakistan are considered to be traditional realist approaches to security, the promotion of economic, environmental and human security reflect global concerns, liberal theories and cosmopolitan values. The book goes beyond traditional security issues to reflect the changing security agenda in South Asia in the twenty-first century, and is a useful contribution to studies on South Asian Politics and Security Studies.</p></span></span>",

It gives a comprehensive overview of the powerful SimPowerSystems toolbox and demonstrates how it can be used to create and investigate models of both classic and modern electrotechnical systems.</p><p><strong><em>Build from Circuit Elements and Blocks to System Models</em></strong></p><p>Building from simple to more complex topics, the book helps readers better understand the principles, features, and detailed functions of various electrical systems, such as electrical drives, power electronics, and systems for production and distribution of electrical energy. The text begins by describing the models of the main circuit elements, which are used to create the full system model, and the measuring and control blocks. It then examines models of semiconductor devices used in power electronics as well as models of DC and AC motors. The final chapter discusses the simulation of power production and transmission systems, including hydraulic turbine, steam turbine, wind, and diesel generators. The author also develops models of systems that improve the quality of electrical energy, such as active filters and various types of static compensators.</p><p><strong><em>Get a Deeper Understanding of Electrical Systems and How to Simulate Them</em></strong></p><p>A companion CD supplies nearly 100 models of electrotechnical systems created using SimPowerSystems. These encompass adaptations of SimPowerSystems demonstrational models, as well as models developed by the author, including many important applications related to power electronics and electrical drives, which are not covered by the demonstrational models. In addition to showing how the models can be used, he supplies the theoretical background for each. Offering a solid understanding of how electrical systems function, this book guides readers to use SimPowerSystems to create and investigate electrical systems, including those under development, more effectively. </p></span><p>This title includes additional digital media when purchased in print format.

			"description": "<span><span><p>Environmental engineering has a leading role in the elimination of ecological threats, and deals, in brief, with securing technically the conditions which create a safe environment for mankind to live in. Due to its interdisciplinary character it can deal with a wide range of technical and technological problems. Since environmental engineering uses the knowledge of the basic sciences – biology, chemistry, biochemistry and physics – it is able to neutralise pollution in all the elements of the environment, i.e. the hydrosphere, atmosphere and lithosphere. Moreover, environmental engineering deals with the design and maintenance of systems of water supply, sewage disposal, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning in buildings.</p><p>Environmental Engineering IV contains 77 peer reviewed papers selected from 527 presented at the 4th Congress of Environmental Engineering (Lublin, Poland, 2-5 September 2012). The contributions are divided into 7 chapters:<br/>• Water supply<br/>• Water and wastewater treatment<br/>• Neutralization of solid wastes and sludge<br/>• Air protection and quality<br/>• Indoor microclimate<br/>• Energy<br/>• Biology and technology</p><p>Environmental Engineering IV assesses the state of scientific research in various areas of environmental engineering, evaluates the organizational, technical and technological progress made in contributing to ecological security, and determines the place of environmental engineering in sustainable development, taking into account current political and economic conditions, and is a valuable source of information for the environmental engineering professional and academic community.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The web is undergoing a fundamental change. It is moving away\nfrom its current structure of documents and pages linked together,\nand towards a new structure that is built around people. This is a\nprofound change that will affect how we create business strategy,\ndesign, marketing, and advertising. The reason for this shift is\nsimple. For tens of thousands of years we’ve been social\nanimals. The web, which is only 20 years old, is simply catching up\nwith offline life.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\nFrom travel to news to commerce, smart businesses are reorienting\ntheir efforts around people – around the social behavior of\ntheir customers and potential customers. In order to be successful,\nbusinesses will need to understand how people are connected, how\ntheir social network influences them, how the people closest to\nthem influence them the most, and how it’s more important for\nmarketers to focus on small, connected groups of friends rather\nthan looking for overly influential individuals.<br/>\n\t\t\t<br/>\nThis book pulls together the latest research from leading\nuniversities and technology companies to describe how people are\nconnected, and how ideas and brand messages spread through social\nnetworks. It shows readers how to rebuild their business around\nsocial behavior, and create products that people tell their friends\nabout.<br/></p></span>",

A good deal of learning will have to take place during the trip and that is why it is necessary to have patience and tolerate the learning process. <b>Organizational Resilience: Managing the Risks of Disruptive Events - A Practitioner’s Guide </b>provides essential management tools that ensure you will succeed in moving an organization towards becoming more resilient. </p><p/><p>The book explains organizational resilience and how to manage risk through the use of the ANSI/ASIS SPC.1-2009 Standard. It outlines a concise, clearly understandable approach to successfully addressing the various challenges and techniques necessary to plan, prepare, and implement organizational resilience management in any organization. The authors cut through the complexities and identify the key issues and methods for successful implementation. They focus on organizational resilience management as an integral component of an overall business and risk management strategy. They also explore how organizational resilience creates value for the organization and can be applied to both the private and public sectors. </p><p/><p>Building a resilient organization is a cross-disciplinary and cross-functional endeavor; therefore \"practitioners\" may come from a variety of disciplines, all of which contribute to helping the organization achieve its objectives. This book provides valuable and much-needed guidance that enables practitioners to achieve the desired goals of effective organizational resilience through cost-effective methods. </p></span>",

Your CSO needs to read\nthis book!\"</p><p><em>—Dr. Vint Cerf, senior vice president of\nTechnology Strategy at MCI and founder of Internet Protocol\n(IP)</em></p><p>\"The power of the Internet is that it's a global network,\nseamlessly crossing borders. But it also brings security risks that\ncan cross borders just as easily. Patterson has more than a decade\nof first-hand experience in defending against such risks and it\nshows. He uses real-world examples and stories, many from his own\ncareer, and offers clear, action-oriented descriptions of the\ndifferent threats and how to deal with them. This book avoids\nsecurity jargon and speaks directly to businesspeople around the\nglobe.\"</p><p><em>—Chris Anderson, Editor in Chief, Wired\nMagazine</em></p><p>Whether consumers or global giants, we all need to be spending a\ngreater share of our budgets on security. The threats are greater\nthan ever and increasing daily, and yet there is a challenge as to\nhow to justify the expenditure. Mapping Security offers\nbusiness-oriented and in-depth thinking on how and why to build\nsecurity into the fabric of the organization. After reading Tom\nPatterson's book, you will want to make changes with a sense of\nurgency.</p><p><em>—John R Patrick, president of Attitude\nLLC and former vice president of</em><em>Internet Technology at IBM\nCorporation</em></p><p>As companies of all sizes go global in their search for profit\nand growth, they will need to understand how to use security as a\ntool for success in different markets, and Mapping Security shows\nthem how.</p><p><em>—Dr. Craig Fields, former director of\nAdvanced Research Projects Agency</em><em>(ARPA) for the U.S.\nGovernment</em></p><p><b>The Definitive Guide to Effective Security in Complex Global\nMarkets</b></p><p>Companies are global today and have complex security supply\nchains, out-sourced operations, and customer relationships that\nspan the world. Today, more than ever, companies must protect\nthemselves against unprecedented threats, understand and adhere to\na global mosaic of regulations, and leverage security to enable\ntoday's business realities. In Mapping Security, global security\nexpert Tom Patterson shows how to meet these challenges by\npresenting security best practices, rules, and customs for\nvirtually every country where you do business.</p><p>Writing for executives, business managers, security\nprofessionals, and consultants, Patterson offers an exceptionally\nthorough and authoritative briefing on today's global security\nrealities. Using real-world examples, he shows how to change your\napproach to security as you move more deeply into global markets:\nhow to resolve contradictions among the complex rules and customs\nyou'll have to follow and how to customize security solutions for\nevery market. Along the way, he introduces the Mapping Security\nIndex (MSI), a powerful new metric for rapidly quantifying security\nrisk associated with 30 key markets.

			"title": "The DV Rebel’s Guide: An All-Digital Approach to Making Killer Action Movies on the Cheap",
			"description": "<span><span><p>Written by Stu Maschwitz, co-founder of the Orphanage (the\nlegendary guerrilla visual effects studio responsible for amazing\nand award-winning effects in such movies as Sin City, The Day After\nTomorrow, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), this book is a\nmust-have for all those budding filmmakers and students who want to\nproduce action movies with visual effects but don't have Hollywood\nbudgets. The Orphanage was created by three twenty-something visual\neffects veterans who wanted to make their own feature films and\ndiscovered they could do this by utilizing home computers, off the\nshelf software, and approaching things artistically. This guide\ndetails exactly how to do this: from planning and selecting the\nnecessary cameras, software, and equipment, to creating specific\nspecial effects (including gunfire, Kung Fu fighting, car chases,\ndismemberment, and more) to editing and mixing sound and music. Its\nmantra is that the best, low-budget action moviemakers must\nvisualize the end product first in order to reverse-engineer the\nleast expensive way to get there. Readers will learn how to\nintegrate visual effects into every aspect of filmmaking--before\nfilming, during filming and with \"in camera\" shots, and with\ncomputers in postproduction. Throughout the book, the author makes\nspecific references to and uses popular action movies (both low and\nbig-budget) as detailed examples--including El Mariachi, La Femme\nNikita, Die Hard, and Terminator 2. Note from the Publisher: If you\nhave the 3rd printing of The DV Rebel’s Guide, your disc may\nbe missing the data files that accompany the book. If this is the\ncase, please send an email to Peachpit in order to obtain the files\nat ask@peachpit.com</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Do you know what is the real cost of your software? Before you\nreach for a calculator, be forewarned that it's a trick question.\nEven technology industry analysts and seasoned IT executives have\ndifficulty putting a hard figure on the Total Cost of Ownership\n(TCO) of today's enterprise application solutions. What makes the\nequation so tricky is the sheer number of variables that must be\nfactored in, many of which cannot be lined up in a neat column and\nreconciled, such as issues of security, availability, performance,\nproblem resolution and change management. <em>The End of Software:\nTransforming Your Business for the On Demand Future</em>, by <b>Dr.\nTimothy Chou</b>, is a groundbreaking book for business managers\nand executives that challenges conventional approaches to business\nsoftware and proposes new alternatives to managing and maintaining\nthe systems that companies depend on.</p><p>Read What Industry Experts Have to Say:</p><ul><li><p>\"Whether you rely on computer software to run your business,\ncreate software solutions, or invest in software companies, you are\nfacing the shift from software as a product to software as a\nservice. In <em>The End of Software</em>, Dr. Timothy Chou makes the\ncase for Software on Demand and shows you who's already out there\ncreating and using this new model.\" Fred Magner, Chief Information\nOfficer, Unocal Corporation</p></li><li><p>\"As a pioneer of the On Demand delivery model, Dr. Chou\nchallenges certain conventions long held by the software industry.\n<em>The End of Software</em> provokes industry participants to\nre-think how big software should be packaged, sold and delivered in\nthe future.\" Stephen Wong, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of\nEmbarcadero Technologies</p></li><li><p>\"Dr. Timothy Chou's book <em>The End of Software</em> presents a\nlogical argument for the shift from selling and buying software, or\nthe promise of the value that software represents, to selling and\nbuying the actual value that software can bring to a user. This is\nvery persuasive, especially when you consider the legacy of\nsoftware vendors, who are notorious for over-promising and\nunder-delivering. As Dr. Chou so clearly understands (and why\nshouldn't he-he's lived it), this new delivery method simply makes\nsense. But the world is often slow to change; as keen observers of\nthe technology industry, we'll be watching closely.\" John S.\nDiFucci, Senior Software Analyst, Managing Director, Bear, Stearns\n&amp; Co.

			"description": "<span><span><p>Group theoretic problems have propelled scientific achievements across a wide range of fields, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, and the life sciences. Many cryptographic constructions exploit the computational hardness of group theoretical problems, and the area is viewed as a potential source of quantum-resilient cryptographic primitives for the future. <br/><br/><b>Group Theoretic Cryptography</b> supplies an ideal introduction to cryptography for those who are interested in group theory and want to learn about the possible interplays between the two fields. Assuming an undergraduate-level understanding of linear algebra and discrete mathematics, it details the specifics of using non-Abelian groups in the field of cryptography. <br/><br/>Moreover, the book evidences how group theoretic techniques help us gain new insight into well known, seemingly unrelated, cryptographic constructions, such as DES. <br/><br/>The book starts with brief overviews of the fundamentals of group theory, complexity theory, and cryptography. Part two is devoted to public-key encryption, including provable security guarantees, public-key encryption in the standard model, and public-key encryption using infinite groups. <br/><br/>The third part of the book covers secret-key encryption. It examines block ciphers, like the Advanced Encryption Standard, and cryptographic hash functions and message authentication codes. The last part delves into a number of cryptographic applications which are nowadays as relevant as encryption—identification protocols, key establishment, and signature schemes are covered.<br/><br/>The book supplies formal security analyses and highlights potential vulnerabilities for cryptographic constructions involving group theory. Summaries and references for further reading, as well as exercises, are included at the end of each chapter. Selected solutions for exercises are provided in the back of the book.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Volume 6A: Motif Programming Manual",
			"description": "<span><div><p>The<em> Motif Programming Manual</em> is a source for complete, accurate, and insightful guidance on Motif application programming. There is no other book that covers the ground as thoroughly or as well as this one. The book has been updated to Motif 1.2, but is still usable with Motif 1.1.The <em>Motif Programming Manual</em> describes how to write applications using the Motif toolkit from the Open Software Foundation (OSF). The book goes into detail on every Motif widget class, with useful examples that will help programmers to develop their own code. Anyone doing Motif programming who doesn't want to have to figure it out on their own needs this book.In addition to information on Motif, the book is full of tips about programming in general and about user interface design.Contents include:</p><ul><li>An introduction to the Motif programming model, how it is based on the X Toolkit Intrinsics, and how it differs from them.</li><li>Chapters on each of the Motif widget classes, explaining them in depth, with useful examples that will help you to improve your own code. For example, the chapter on menus shows how to develop utility functions that generalize and simplify menu creation. All of the code shown in the book is available free of charge over the Internet or via UUCP.</li><li>Coverage of the drag-and-drop mechanism for transferring data. Two extensive examples show how to implement custom drag source and drop site functionality in a Motif application.</li><li>A tutorial on UIL. The chapters on UIL describe all of the techniques used to create an interface with this prototyping tool. The numerous examples cover the basics and explore ways to use UIL to facilitate rapid prototyping.</li></ul>\nThe book assumes competence with the C programming language, as well as familiarity with fundamental X Window System concepts. The <em>Motif Programming Manual</em> is not only the most comprehensive guide to writing applications with Motif, it is an integral part of the most widely used series of books on X as a whole. It complements and builds upon the earlier books in the X Window System Series from O'Reilly &amp; Associates, as well as on OSF's own Motif Style Guide. Best when paired with Volume 6B, <em>Motif Reference Manual</em>.</div></span>",

In the field of photonics, a wide range of numerical methods are used for studying both fundamental optics and applications such as design, development, and optimization of photonic components. Modeling is key for developing improved photonic devices and reducing development time and cost.</p><p>Choosing the appropriate computational method for a photonics modeling problem requires a clear understanding of the pros and cons of the available numerical methods. <b>Numerical Methods in Photonics</b> presents six of the most frequently used methods: FDTD, FDFD, 1+1D nonlinear propagation, modal method, Green’s function, and FEM. </p><p>After an introductory chapter outlining the basics of Maxwell’s equations, the book includes self-contained chapters that focus on each of the methods. Each method is accompanied by a review of the mathematical principles in which it is based, along with　sample scripts, illustrative examples of characteristic problem solving, and exercises. MATLAB® is used throughout the text.</p><p>This book provides a solid basis to practice writing your own codes. The theoretical formulation is complemented by sets of exercises, which allow you to grasp the essence of the modeling tools. </p></span>",

The 9/11 attacks—and other attacks on surface transportation assets, including the bombings in Madrid, London, Moscow, and Mumbai—demonstrate the vulnerability of the open systems to disruption and the consequences of the attacks on people, property, and the economy. Now more than ever, it has become imperative for businesses operating in the transportation and transit sectors to develop comprehensive security programs accounting for both natural and man-made hazards and safeguarding people, places, and equipment—while at the same time ensuring operations continuity. Providing transportation managers with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to effectively manage the security of transportation assets, <strong>Introduction to Transportation Security</strong> examines:</p><p/><ul><p>\n</p><li>Basic theories of security and emergency management</li><li>The integrated nature of the nation’s critical infrastructure and the threats to transportation in each surface mode</li><li>Federal agencies working in emergency management and transportation security and their intelligence and response requirements and capabilities</li><li>The types of disasters that have occurred in the U.S. and selected nations, and their significant economic impacts</li><li>Cost-beneficial security strategies aimed at preventing catastrophic failures in each transportation mode</li><li>Effective methods for organizing, testing, and evaluating transportation security across modes and professions</li><p/></ul><p/><p>The book covers all transportation modes and their interconnectivity—including highway, air cargo, freight and passenger rail, transit, and maritime.

			"description": "<span><span><span><span><p><em><b>Building Web Applications with UML</b></em> is a guide to\nbuilding robust, scalable, and feature-rich web applications using\nproven object-oriented techniques. Written for the project manager,\narchitect, analyst, designer, and programmer of web applications,\nthis book examines the unique aspects of modeling web applications\nwith the Web Application Extension (WAE) for the Unified Modeling\nLanguage (UML). The UML has been widely accepted as the standard\nmodeling language for software systems, and as a result is often\nthe best option for modeling web application designs.</p><p>The WAE extends the UML notation with semantics and constraints\nenabling developers to model web-specific architectural elements\nusing the Rational Unified Process or an alternative methodology.\nUsing UML allows developers to model their web applications as a\npart of the complete system and the business logic that must be\nreflected in the application. Readers will gain not only an\nunderstanding of the modeling process, but also the ability to map\nmodels directly into code.</p><p>Key topics include:</p><li><p>A basic introduction to web servers, browsers, HTTP, and\nHTML</p></li><li><p>Gathering requirements and defining the system's use cases</p></li><li><p>Transforming requirements into a model and then a design that\nmaps directly into components of the system</p></li><li><p>Defining the architecture of a web application with an\nexamination of three architectural patterns describing\narchitectures for thin web client, thick web client, and web\ndelivery designs</p></li><li><p>Modeling, at the appropriate level of abstraction and detail,\nthe appropriate artifacts, including web application pages, page\nrelationships, navigate routes, client-side scripts, and\nserver-side generation</p></li><li><p>Creating code from UML models using ASP and VBScript</p></li><li><p>Client-side scripting using DHTML, Java Script, VBScript,\nApplets, ActiveX controls, and DOM</p></li><li><p>Using client/server protocols including DCOM, CORBA/IIOP, and\nJava's RMI</p></li><li><p>Securing a web application with SET, SSL, PGP, Certificates,\nand Certificate Authorities</p></li><p><br/><br/>\n0201615770B04062001</p></span></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><i>Economic Integration in South Asia: Issues and Pathways</i> is one of the volumes of the series titled, Imagine a New South Asia, presented by ActionAid International Asia. This volume envisions a new South Asia, free from human deprivation and poverty, where countries will become successful, proud and inclusive societies. This book demonstrates how South Asian countries can learn from the best practices in the region as well as from their failures, and also by trying to emulate the successful strategies of introducing egalitarian education and health systems of East Asia, China and Southeast Asian countries. Rich in analysis and research, this volume seeks an alternative people-centred perspective, and takes into account all those voices that have so long been unheard in policy-making processes through reviews of case studies. Not only will the findings of this volume be useful in conducting campaigns for appropriate policy and mindset changes, but these will also, eventually, make the emergence of a highly integrated South Asia truly possible.\n\t</span>",

Have you found yourself making decisions in a void due to the lack of useful and easily accessible operational data? Have you ever worried that you are being left behind with the emergence of data analytics? Do you feel there are important stories in your operational data that need to be told, but you have no idea how to find these stories? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this book is for you. <i>How Libraries Should Manage Data</i> provides detailed instructions on how to transform your operational data from a fog of disconnected, unreliable, and inaccessible information - into an exemplar of best practice data management. Like the human brain, most people are only using a very small fraction of the true potential of Excel. Learn how to tap into a greater proportion of Excel’s hidden power, and in the process transform your operational data into actionable business intelligence. </p><br/><br/><ul><li>Recognize and overcome the social barriers to creating useful operational data</li><li>Understand the potential value and pitfalls of operational data</li><li>Learn how to structure your data to obtain useful information quickly and easily</li><li>Create your own desktop library cube with step-by-step instructions, including DAX formulas</li></ul></span></span>",

This method focuses on how the money is allocated, rather than on future returns.<br/><br/>The Sortino method presents an innovative change from this traditional approach. Rather than using the client’s risk as the main factor, this method uses the client’s desired return.<br/><br/>• Only book to describe the Sortino method and Desired Target Return™ in a way that enables portfolio managers to adopt the method<br/>• Software to implement the portfolio construction method is included free of charge to book buyers on a password protected Elsevier website. Book buyers can use the software to construct portfolios using this method right away, in real time. They can also load in their current portfolios and measure them against these measures.<br/>• The Sortino method has been tested over 20 years at the Pension Research Institute. Portfolio managers can be confident of the success of the method, even returns in the economic crisis, in which the method has still beaten all S&amp;P benchmarks.</span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Strong security has always been part of the family of Lotus\nsoftware products. More notably, it has been a feature that has\nmade Lotus Notes and Domino an industry leader for security-rich\nmessaging, calendar, and scheduling capabilities. with a robust\nplatform for collaborative applications. With Lotus Notes and\nDomino 7, IBM extends the reach of Lotus Domino messaging and\ncollaboration solutions while continuing to leverage your IT and\napplication investments. The new version offers capabilities to\nsupport more people with fewer servers, to simplify administration,\nand to provide tighter integration with Web standards.</p><p>In this IBM Redbooks publication, we discuss specific security\nand anti-spam enhancements that have been incorporated into Notes\nand Domino 7.0.</p><p>This publication is the fourth in a series about IBM Lotus\nsecurity to be published. The previous IBM Redbooks about the topic\nare, in chronological order, \"The Domino Defense: Security in Lotus\nNotes 4.5 and the Internet,\" SG24-4848, \"Lotus Notes and Domino\nR5.0 Security Infrastructure Revealed,\" SG24-5341, and \"Lotus\nSecurity Handbook,\" SG24-7017.</p><p>The primary goal of these publications was to focus on the\nstrong security that has always been part of the family of Lotus\nproducts.<br/>\nThe present publication continues down the path set by these\nprevious Redbooks, offering, as with each previous release,\ninformation about key features and functionalities pertaining to\nthe security aspects of Lotus Notes and Domino Release 7.0.x, as\nwell as best practices to implement these new features and\nfunctionalities.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>This IBM Redbooks publication describes the big phases in a\nbusiness integration project. First, we discuss the planning and\nsystem design phase for a business integration infrastructure that\nshould be able to support several business integration\nprojects.</p><p>When the planning and design is complete, we discuss the\nimplementation of several run-time engines of a WebSphere Business\nIntegration Server V4.2.2 implementation. We also cover the\nimplementation steps for a development environment and an\nadministration environment.</p><p>The next phase is the development and testing of a business\nintegration solution that can be deployed within the\ninfrastructure. The integration solution combines the powers of the\nthree run-time engines of WebSphere Business Integration Server\nV4.2.2, providing for human interaction, straight-through\nprocessing, and message brokering and aggregation.</p><p>The last phase of a business integration project is the process\nof moving the solution to production and determining how to manage\nthis solution, addressing such issues as how to stop and start\ncomponents in a coordinated way, and where to find answers for\nrun-time problems. The book ends with a discussion about\nperformance tuning that is focused on WebSphere InterChange Server\nV4.2.2.</p></span>",

Now that you’ve performed those 30\nexercises, wouldn’t it be great if there were another set of\n30 exercises you could complete that would challenge you in the\nsame way? You’re in luck. Introducing the Creative Boot Camp\nBooster Packs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Creative Boot Camp Booster Packs offer 90 new creative\nexercises, separated into two collections: The Medium Collection\nand The General Mix Collection. The Medium Collection offers the 90\nexercises segregated by medium: 30 Designer, 30 Writer, and 30\nPhotographer. The General Mix Collection offers the same 90\nexercises in three mixed packs: Brigadier, Major, and Lieutenant.\nEach mixed Booster Pack contains 10 designer, 10 writer, and 10\nphotographer exercises.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Booster Pack is the Designer Edition, which means the\nexercises are tailored towards designers. But don’t think\nthat every exercise requires artistic execution. Rather, design\nthinking is the skill you’ll be developing through most of\nthis Booster Pack. Solve these problems with relevance and novelty\nand you’ll find the creative boost you are seeking by the\nconclusion of the pack.<br/>\n<br/></p></span></span>",

As traditional hospital structures meet the entrepreneurial physician manager in today’s rapidly changing environment, numerous transitional challenges are emerging. <br/><br/><b>Medical Staff Integration: Transactions and Transformation</b> fills the void that exists between hospital management texts and physician management literature. It examines the cultural and functional issues that must be addressed when hospitals and health systems purchase physician practices.<br/><br/>Written by a leading consultant in the health care industry, the book covers the changes occurring in a nonjudgmental fashion and from a business case perspective. It supplies an understanding of the basics behind the various types of relationships that are forming as well as the nuts and bolts of the transitions that will result.<br/><br/>The book focuses on the challenges readers will most likely face when merging systems, culture, and functions. It explains how to assure that the acquisitions will meet the needs of all parties—emphasizing the income determination structures required for the continued motivation of physicians. <br/><br/>Addressing some of the limitations hospitals face with physician practice integrations, including the traditional medical staff structure, hospital-based physicians, and contracted physicians, the book also discusses the growing role and impact of compliance.<br/><br/>A companion website allows readers to download forms and models which can assist in the practical application of the ideas presented in the book. www.medicalstaffintegration.com</p></span>",

The first part  serves as an introduction to Jabber; you'll learn about its features,  why it's more than an IM system, and how to install and configure a  Jabber server of your own. The second part provides detailed information  about the Jabber protocol, and a series of practical examples, which can  be used to solve everyday problems. The examples, in Perl, Python, and Java,  use various Jabber features as a way of illustrating parts of the protocol.<i>Programming Jabber</i> provides the foundation and framework for  developers to hit the ground running, and is <i>the</i> essential book  on Jabber.</div></span>",

			"title": "Physician Integration & Alignment",
			"description": "<span><p>Today, with physician and hospital reimbursement being cut and tied to quality incentives, physicians and health plans are revisiting the concept of integration. Payers are demanding that the industry do more with less without sacrificing quality of care. As a result, physicians again find themselves integrating and aligning with　hospitals that have the resources they lack or must develop together.<br/><br/>Written by an acknowledged expert in the field of physician integration and managed care contracting, <strong>Physician </strong><b>Integration &amp; Alignment: IPA, PHO, ACOs, and Beyond</b> examines physician integration and alignment in the current healthcare market. It outlines the common characteristics of integrated groups and various organizational structures, and also explains how you can avoid making the same mistakes of the past. Filled with suggestions and ideas from successfully integrated practices, the book:</p><ul><li>Identifies industry drivers for the resurgence of integrated models and the need for aligned models</li><li>Provides a look at the common characteristics of integrated and aligned groups and how the components can work together</li><li>Discusses antitrust and other regulatory concerns present when considering the right organizational and management structure</li><li>Offers time- and money-saving checklists, lessons learned, models, and templates—saving you thousands of dollars in consulting fees</li><p/></ul><p/><p>Maria K. Todd provides readers with the vision and practical tools needed to organize their business entities in a manner that will maximize economic clout and provide quality of care for both the hospital and physician group. This much-needed resource includes helpful insights on topics such as declining physician reimbursement, declining margins, physician shortages, physician-hospital competition, rising practice investment requirements, the return to capitation as a payment mechanism, and recent changes in the relationships between physicians and health systems.<br/><br/>Maria currently is the principle of the largest globally integrated health delivery system in the world with over 6,000 hospitals and 85,000 physicians spanning 95 countries. She has developed more than 200 integrated and aligned IPAs, PHOs, ACOs, MSOs and healthcare clusters in her career.</p></span>",

Now that\nyou’ve performed those 30 exercises, wouldn’t it be\ngreat if there were another set of 30 exercises you could complete\nthat would challenge you in the same way? You’re in luck.\nIntroducing the Creative Boot Camp Booster Packs.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Creative Boot Camp Booster Packs offer 90 new creative\nexercises, separated into two collections: The Medium Collection\nand The General Mix Collection. The Medium Collection offers the 90\nexercises segregated by medium: 30 Designer, 30 Writer, and 30\nPhotographer. The General Mix Collection offers the same 90\nexercises in three mixed packs: Brigadier, Major, and Lieutenant.\nEach mixed Booster Pack contains 10 designer, 10 writer, and 10\nphotographer exercises.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis Booster Pack is the Writer Edition, which means the exercises\nare tailored towards writers. But don’t think that every\nexercise requires a silver-tongued pen. Most of these are\nidea-driven more than language-driven so focus on the ideas behind\nthe words.

Reynolds eschews radical calls for throwing out the 401(k) entirely and creating a new government-run savings system. Our best course, he shows, is to build on what we have: a flexible, dynamic private-public system of Social Security and more robust workplace savings. <em>From Here to Security </em>provides a clear, powerful new approach to solving America’s retirement challenge – based on facts, data, and Reynolds’ decades of experience.</p><p>While fear-mongers claim that the U.S. retirement system is on the verge of collapse; Reynolds shows why our system is actually the envy of the world. But <i>From Here to Security</i> is no status quo book.</p><p>Reynolds lays out an action agenda to dramatically improve our retirement systems – public and private -- lift our savings rate, improve people’s retirement prospects, spur faster growth – and reboot America’s national morale.</p><p><br/></p><p/></span>",

Whether we attain this stage of global well-being, however, will depend on how well our business institutions adapt and change.<br/>The Fourth Wave examines the ways business has changed in the second and third waves and must continue to change in the fourth. The changes concern the basics-how an institution is organized, how it defines wealth, how it relates to surrounding communities, how it responds to environmental needs, and how it takes part in the political process.<br/>Maynard and Mehrtens foresee a radically different future in which business principles, concern for the environment, personal integrity, and spiritual values are integrated. The authors also demonstrate the need for a new kind of leadership-managers and CEOs who embrace an attitude of global stewardship; who define their assets as ideas, information, creativity, and vision; and who strive for seamless boundaries between work and private lives for all employees.\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span>Best execution, market integration, and other major financial market issues have traditionally been dealt with as separate matters requiring individual solutions.  In <b>Achieving Market Integration</b> the author demonstrates the interrelated nature of these and other imperative problems, and sensibly reduces them to their common fundamental principles.  Beginning with an in-depth examination of best execution in today's multiple-market environment, the book moves logically into an examination of market structure and the problems of achieving genuine integration.  The book makes the case that order interaction is fundamental to addressing each of these issues, and develops a unified regulatory approach to achieve true market integration based on intermarket linkages and a cross-market best execution policy.  This unique approach culminates in a coherent set of policy recommendations and an innovative framework for assessing the effectiveness of future policy proposals.<br/><br/>*The first book on this important subject for the finance community <br/>*Explains the aims and proposes solutions to the difficulties of establishing a stock market that integrates the diverse national exchanges around Europe <br/>*Provides a discussion point for those lobbying the European Commission on formulating regulation for an integrated European capital market</span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Describing state-of-the-art solutions in distributed system architectures, <strong>Integration of Services into Workflow Applications</strong> presents a concise approach to the integration of loosely coupled services into workflow applications. It discusses key challenges related to the integration of distributed systems and proposes solutions, both in terms of theoretical aspects such as models and workflow scheduling algorithms, and technical solutions such as software tools and APIs.<br/><br/>The book provides an in-depth look at workflow scheduling and proposes a way to integrate several different types of services into one single workflow application. It shows how these components can be expressed as services that can subsequently be integrated into workflow applications. The workflow applications are often described as acyclic graphs with dependencies which allow readers to define complex scenarios in terms of basic tasks.<br/></p><ul><li>Presents state-of-the-art solutions to challenges in multi-domain workflow application definition, optimization, and execution</li><li>Proposes a uniform concept of a service that can represent executable components in all major distributed software architectures used today</li><li>Discusses an extended model with determination of data flows among parallel paths of a workflow application</li><p/></ul><p>Since workflow applications often process big data, the book explores the dynamic management of data with various storage constraints during workflow execution. It addresses several practical problems related to data handling, including data partitioning for parallel processing next to service selection and scheduling, processing data in batches or streams, and constraints on data sizes that can be processed at the same time by service instances. <br/><br/>Illustrating several workflow applications that were proposed, implemented, and benchmarked in a real BeesyCluster environment, the book includes templates for multidisciplinary workflow applications that readers can use in a wide range of contexts. </p></span>",

What went wrong? Did anyone see it coming? What lessons can we learn from this? <br/> <br/>And is it really all that bad?<br/><br/><b/> <br/> <br/><br/><i>Fooled Again </i>is not a history book, but it looks at the history of recent financial management, mismanagement, extraordinary risk and greed, flows of global capital and international toxic balance sheets to identity the key lessons to be learned from the global financial crisis. <br/> <br/>Taking a considered and long-term view, Meyrick Chapman gives an immensely readable and insightful view of what really happened and shows us why not all crises are bad, and why the events of 2008 and 2009 may ultimately benefit us.<br/> <br/> </span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Self-Balancing is not just a tweak or change to assembly line balancing, but a completely transformed method for achieving continuous flow. Among the reasons you should try Self-Balancing is that you can expect a productivity improvement of at least 30 percent—with improvements of 50-60 percent quite common.<br/><br/>Using a well-tested method for successful improvements initiated by the author, <strong>The Basics of Self-Balancing Processes: True Lean Continuous Flow</strong> is the first book to explain how to achieve continuous flow in both simple and complex manufacturing environments. It describes how to recognize and resolve weak links to ensure continuous flow in your manufacturing operations.<br/><br/>The book offers rules, tools, and guidelines to help you not only solve problems at the root, but even eliminate them before they start. It reviews the shortcomings of traditional assembly line balancing and walks readers through the new paradigm of Self-Balancing.<br/><br/>The text includes a comprehensive overview that demonstrates the power, flexibility, and breakthroughs possible with this method. Offering solutions to the shortcomings associated with standard line balancing—including inventory buffers, variation, and operator pace—it provides you with the tools and understanding required to deal with batch and off-line processes, debug your line, arrange your parts and tools, and design your own Self-Balanced cells. </p>\nWatch Gordon Ghirann discuss how his book can increase the productivity of your business.\n<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yte0622XbcI&amp;feature=youtu.be</p></span></span>",

It addresses the following issues: what is the new definition of energy security, how does it affect global politics and international relations? What are the energy security concerns of China and India, and what policies and approaches have they taken to deal with energy security issues? Since China and India are searching for oil and gas in the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, will their acquisition efforts conflict with the interests of other energy giants such as the U.S., Japan, and will their growing overseas activities challenge U.S. policy in those energy-rich regions?</p><p>The book provides insight into what the new global energy order may be and how the growth models and energy structures may shape the economic growth and energy. It analyzes both the state-centered approach and market-oriented approach in the global quest for energy resources. It also examines how China and India can adopt a cooperative approach for beneficial relations. </p><p>The book will be of interest to anyone who is keen to learn how the World especially U.S.A. can accomodate and adapt to the new global energy dynamics; China and India as new players in global energy markets. </p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Transparent in the visible range, phase objects can be studied in the optical range using holographic interferometry. Typically, the holograms are recorded on high-resolving-power holographic photo materials, but a lower spatial resolution is sufficient for successful research in many scientific applications. <strong>Holographic Interferometry: A Mach–Zehnder Approach</strong> offers practical guidance to research scientists and engineers using Mach–Zehnder holographic interferometry methods to study phase objects in the laboratory. The Mach–Zehnder approach allows the use of standard photographic film and electronic CCD/CMOS sensors with low resolving power, making it a simpler and more affordable option for testing many types of phase objects.</p><p/><p>This book demonstrates how to use standard photographic film for the optical recording and reconstruction of Mach–Zehnder holograms. It also illustrates techniques for using CCD/CMOS cameras to digitally record Mach–Zehnder holograms/interferograms of transparent objects. Bringing together original research and information scattered throughout existing literature, this book focuses on the holographic reference beam and shearing interferometry methods. In particular, it looks at how these methods and optical schemes can be directly applied to testing aerodynamic flows, as well as to plasmas, shocks, and waves in noncoherent laser–matter interactions. </p><p/><p>Numerous reconstructed and classic interferograms, deflectograms, and Schlierengrams illustrate the material, helping readers develop and design their own optimal optical scheme and choose applicable details to apply the approach. Describing methods in a mathematically simple and accessible way, this book is also suitable for graduate students in the fields of aerospace engineering and optics, as well as those in laser, thermal, and plasma physics.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>\n     Christine Pelosi presents leadership lessons from the campaign trail from a diverse array of over forty public figures, lending advice for anyone who wants to run for office, advocate for a cause, or win a public policy issue. This book draws from her leadership “boot camps” conducted in over thirty American states and in three foreign countries, working with thousands of volunteers and dozens of successful candidates for office from city council to US congress.<br/> <br/>Campaign Boot Camp 2.0 is basic training for future leaders who hear a call to service—a voice of conscience that springs from their vision, ideas, and values—and want to translate that call into positive change. Pelosi outlines the seven essential steps to winning: identify your call to service, define your message, know your community, build your leadership teams, raise the money, connect with people, and mobilize to win. Each chapter concludes with a “Get Real” exercise so readers can personalize and integrate these ideas into individual efforts.<br/> <br/>In this edition, Pelosi updates the book's “Call to Service” profiles of political leaders and their calls to service; details the expanding role of social media, the Internet, and technology as message multipliers; explores challenges unique to women candidates; and expands on the power of volunteers.<br/>\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span><p>\n\tIn the United States today we have good reasons to be afraid. Our Bill of Rights is no more. It has been rendered pointless by heavy surveillance of average citizens, political persecution of dissenters, and the potential of indefinite detention now codified into law. Our democracy and freedoms are impaired daily by government control of information, systemic financial corruption, unfettered corporate influence in our elections, and by corporate-controlled international institutions. The Constitution of The United States that has shielded us for more than 200 years from the tentacles of oppressive government and the stranglehold of private wealth becomes more meaningless with each new act of corporate-ocracy.<br/>\n<br/>\n\tBehind a thinning veneer of democracy, the Corporate Security State is tipping the balance between the self-interest of a governing corporate elite and the rights of the people to freedom, safety and fairness. The consequences of these trends and conditions are devastating. We are submerged in endless war, and the wealth produced by and in the United States skews upward in greater concentrations every year. The middle class is under financial attack, as Washington prepares to loot Social Security and Medicare to finance the insatiable war-making and profit-taking.  <br/>\n<br/>\n\tRepression descends on a people slowly at first, but then crushes quickly, silencing dissent. According to the author of <em><strong>Rise of The American Corporate Security State</strong></em>, Beatrice Edwards, our task now is to recognize the real reasons to be afraid in 21st century America, and address them.  Our early steps in the right direction may be small ones, but they are important. They are based on the principle that we, as Americans, have a right to know what our government is doing and to speak openly about it. Creeping censorship, secret courts, clandestine corporate control are all anathema to democratic practices and must be corrected now, before this last chance to redeem our rights is lost.</p></span>",

Derived from the detailed, carefully normalized database at preeminent project consultancy IPA, this solid framework is applicable to all types of capital investment projects large and small, in any sector, including technology, life sciences, petroleum, consumer products, and more. Although grounded in empirical research and rigorous data analysis, this book is not an academic discussion or a conceptual dissertation; it's a practical, actionable, on-the-ground guide to making your project succeed. Clear discussion tackles the challenges that cause capital projects to fail or underperform, and lays out exactly what it takes to successfully manage a project using real-world methods that apply at any level.</p><p>Businesses report that 60 percent of their projects fail to meet all business objectives, and IPA's database shows that projects' final average net present  value undershoots initial estimates by 28 percent. This book provides concrete, actionable solutions to help you avoid the pitfalls and lead the way toward a more positive outcome.</p><ul><li>Avoid the missteps that make capital projects fail</li><li>Learn the specific practices that drive project success</li><li>Understand what effective capital project management entails</li><li>Discover real-world best practices that generate more value from capital</li></ul><p>When capital projects fail, it is almost always preventable.

			"description": "<span><p>The book by Magdalena Lubanska examines the role of religious syncretism in the social and religious life of Muslim-Christian communities in the Western Rhodopes. The author is interested mainly in the origins and motivations of various beliefs and behaviors which at first sight may appear to be syncretic. She looks at syncretism in the context of anti-syncretic tendencies, particularly pronounced among the Muslim neophytes and young members of the Muslim religious elite, who are not interested in the local forms of post-ottoman Islam (“Adat Islam”), preferring instead a “pure” form of religion, a class of fundamentalist religious movements rooted in orthodox Islam and seeking to remain faithful to mainstream Islamic thought and tradition (“Salafi Islam”). Lubanska findings offer an insight into the fact that although certain actions may appear syncretic in nature, their underlying intentions are often not in fact motivated by syncretic tendencies. This is the first study to look at syncretism in Bulgaria from this perspective. </p></span>",

Yet the myths around rugged individualism, meritocracy, and rags-to-riches upward mobility stubbornly persist. As “pro-entrepreneurship” as the United States seems, most Americans aren't very knowledgeable about how business really works. Millions of newly minted business owners don't know the importance—or even existence—of invisible capital.  <br/><br/>Invisible capital is a complex set of factors—our skills, knowledge, networks, resources, and experiences—that can mean the difference between success and failure. Chris Rabb details how people can identify, grow, and leverage their invisible capital and explains why starting a business with deep community roots increases the chance of success.<br/><br/>Understanding invisible capital will enable more Americans to be better prepared to pursue entrepreneurship and level the playing field—because hard work, a great idea, and a good attitude simply aren't enough.<br/>\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>Over the last few decades, power, information and resources have moved from being concentrated in the hands of a few, to being disbursed across many. We need look no further than events on the world stage to see the heat signature of this – from the arrival of Wikileaks, the Arab Spring of 2011 and the Occupy movements, to the social media revolution and flashpoints such as the British Members of Parliament expenses scandal.  All are examples of deep change occurring.</p><p>This book is about what this means for the workplace and for management.  The proposition offered here is that our organisations need to catch up, and that the \"death of deference\" that we are seeing elsewhere in society needs to be accelerated in the workplace.</p><p>Systems of deference slow down organisational performance.  Deference prevents organisations from learning.  It stops them from being agile, innovative and ethical.  Deference is the enemy of organisational success and it needs to be dismantled so that in its place we can build modern organisations with a new breed of managers and leaders.  This book offers a solution to a problem that belongs in the last century, and a game plan for nothing short of a workplace revolution.</p><p>\"If deference is dead, this book is about the resurrection of the effective manager in a world where nothing is quite the way it used to be. Powerful and thought-provoking from start to finish.\"</p><p>- Jeremy Vine, BBC Presenter and Author</p><p>\"<em>Never Mind the Bosses</em> is a refreshing type of management book, it advocates that deference to authority figures needs to go if we are to have engaged workforces.\"</p><p>- Cary L. Cooper, CBE, Distinguished Professor of Organizational Psychology and Health at Lancaster University Management School</p><p>\"An engaging and entertaining romp through the post punk world. By going beyond the boundaries of most business books, Ryde gives us all food for thought about how organisations are, or are not, dealing with a rapidly changing society and workforce.\"</p><p>- Jo Owen, bestselling author of 'How to Manage' and 'How to Lead'</p><p>\"If you are looking for a book that will shake up your thinking about how to improve your organization's performance – or worried that your competitors will find it first! – try this one.\"</p><p>- Professor Dutch Leonard, Harvard Business School &amp; Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Recent research has brought the application of microwaves from the classical fields of heating, communication, and generation of plasma discharges into the generation of compact plasmas that can be used for applications such as FIB and small plasma thrusters. However, these new applications bring with them a new set of challenges. With coverage ranging from the basics to new and emerging applications, <b>Compact Plasma and Focused Ion Beams</b> discusses how compact high-density microwave plasmas with dimensions smaller than the geometrical cutoff dimension can be generated and utilized for providing focused ion beams of various elements. </p><p>Starting with the fundamentals of the cutoff problem for wave propagation in waveguides and plasma diagnostics, the author goes on to explain in detail the plasma production by microwaves in a compact geometry and narrow tubes. He then thoroughly discusses wave interaction with bounded plasmas and provides a deeper understanding of the physics. The book concludes with an up-to-date account of recent research on pulsed microwaves and the application of compact microwave plasmas for multi-element FIB. </p><p>It provides a consolidated and unified description of the emerging areas in plasma science and technology utilizing wave-based plasma sources based on the author’s own work and experience. The book will be useful not only to established researchers in this area but will also serve as an excellent introduction to those interested in applying these ideas to various current and new applications.</p></span></span>",

This book presents the most widely employed approaches to plasmonics and the numerous applications associated with it. There are several underlying elements in plasmonics research. Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have made possible the fabrication of plasmonic nanostructures, deposition of thin films, and development of highly sensitive optical characterization techniques. The different approaches to nanostructuring metals have led to a wealth of interesting optical properties and functionality via manipulation of the plasmon modes that such structures support. The sensitivity of plasmonic structures to the changes in their local dielectric environment has led to the development of new sensing strategies and systems for chemical analysis and identification. The book discusses all of these aspects.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>In this Wrox Blox, you'll learn how to program using industry-standard best practices, coving code organization, indention, file structure, and organization. You'll be introduced to the base2 JavaScript framework, which provides a stable backbone for rapid JavaScript application development by bridging and patching cross-browser inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies. This Wrox Blox describes how base2's developer Dean Edwards has made base2's event API consistent and loyal to the W3C standard event API by implementing the standard addEventListener() method in Internet Explorer, thereby providing a standard event API that can be used in all popular, modern browsers.</p><p>You will also learn about base2's pioneering support for the W3C Selectors API that was recently natively implemented in Internet Explorer 8.0, Firefox 3.1, Safari 3.0, and Opera 10. base2 utilizes the native implementation when one is present for speed and efficiency and falls back on its own implementation when one is not present.</p><p>In addition, you will learn about a couple of methods from base2's rich API set. base2 provides the indexOf() and lastIndexOf() methods for arrays, and provides several other useful enhancements to strings and arrays, such as the forEach() method, which makes enumeration less verbose.</p><p>Finally, base2 is even looking forward to the emerging HTML5 draft specification with support for the classList property and its methods, add(), remove(), toggle(), and has(), which let you easily manipulate the class names of elements in the DOM.</p><ul><li><p>Programming conventions and best practices</p></li><li><p>Provides tips that will make your markup and JavaScript code appear more polished, organized, and professional.</p></li><li><p>How to make your markup and JavaScript code easier to debug</p></li><li><p>Discusses how you can use base2 to repair and bridge standards support in browsers</p></li><li><p>Describes how you can use the W3C's event API in all modern browsers, including Internet Explorer</p></li><li><p>Covers brand new browser support for the W3C Selectors API, first implemented in JavaScript in base2, now implemented natively in upcoming versions of every major browser, including Internet Explorer 8, Safari 3, Firefox 3.1 and Opera 10</p></li><li><p>Also includes some discussion of base2's support for de facto standards, such as Mozilla's array extras, and the DOMContentLoaded event, which reduce the amount of code you need to write, in addition to making your scripts load more quickly.</p></li></ul></span></span>",

One advantage is that components let you divide your applications into modules that you can develop and maintain separately. By implementing commonly used logic within custom components, you can also build a suite of reusable components that you can share among multiple Flex applications.</p><p>Also, you can extend the Flex class hierarchy to base your custom components on the set of predefined Flex components. You can create custom versions of Flex visual controls, as well as custom versions of nonvisual components, such as validators, formatters, and effects.</p><p>You can build an entire Flex application in a single MXML file that contains both your MXML code and any supporting ActionScript code. As your application gets larger, your single file also grows in size and complexity. This type of application would soon become difficult to understand and debug, and very difficult for multiple developers to work on simultaneously.</p></span>",
