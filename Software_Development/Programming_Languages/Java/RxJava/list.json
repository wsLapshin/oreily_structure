			"description": "<span><div><p>Upgrade your skillset, succeed at work, and above all, avoid the many headaches that come with modern front-end development. Simplify your codebase with hands-on examples pulled from real-life applications. Master the mysteries of asynchronous state management, detangle puzzling race conditions, and send spaceships soaring through the cosmos.  When you finish this book, you'll be able to tame the wild codebeasts before they ever get a chance to wreck your day.</p><p>The front-end world can be fraught with complexity.  The RxJS library offers a solution: Observables. Observables merge other JavaScript asynch mechanisms such as callbacks and promises into a new way of looking at data. Instead of dealing with objects and keeping track of their state, Observables view asynchronous events as a stream. RxJS provides you the tools to manage, manipulate, and process Observables to simplify and speed up your front-end applications.</p><p>Never fear, you're in exactly the right place.  Don't worry about getting stuck in a mire of theory. Start off with the basics, building small applications that illustrate deeper points. Take those building blocks and apply them to much more complex problems like handling asynchronous state and dodging race conditions before they happen.  Once you've got a handle on complex problems, take a leap into architecture, discovering how to structure an Observable-based application both without a framework and in the land of Angular 2.  After mastering Observables, switch gears to building a canvas-based game, demonstrating your deep understanding of the flexibility of Observables.</p><p>Master the Observable with RxJS, and make your asynchronous JavaScript code that much cleaner and simpler.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>Any major browser and text editor, as well as the current versions of git, NodeJS, and npm.</p></div></span>",

You will also learn simpler ways to achieve concurrency and remain highly performant, with no need for synchronization. Later on, we will leverage backpressure and other strategies to cope with rapidly-producing sources to prevent bottlenecks in your application. After covering custom operators, testing, and debugging, the book dives into hands-on examples using RxJava on Android as well as Kotlin.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book will be different from other Rx books, taking an approach that comprehensively covers Rx concepts and practical applications.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

Discover how to use the RxJS library to write programs in \na simpler way, unifying asynchronous mechanisms such as callbacks and promises into \na single, powerful construct. Learn to think about your programs as streams of data \nthat you can transform by expressing <i>what</i> should happen, instead of having \nto painstakingly program <i>how</i> it should happen. You'll be able to handle real-world \nconcurrency and write complex flows of events in your applications with ease.</p><p>Create highly concurrent applications while writing simpler code using the Reactive \nExtensions for JavaScript (RxJS), a set of libraries for event composition. Programming \nreal-world applications in JavaScript involves lots of asynchronous events--you \nmight end up spending more time coordinating asynchronous code in your program than \nwriting its actual functionality. This book introduces concepts and tools from reactive \nprogramming that will help you write cleaner and more robust asynchronous programs.</p><p>Find out about Observable sequences, a unifying data type to write highly concurrent \ncode. Discover Schedulers and change the concept of time in your applications, making \nasynchronous testing sane again. Along the way you'll see real-world examples for \nthe browser and Node.js, including a real-time earthquake visualization in 20 lines \nof code and a frantic shoot-'em-up space videogame. You'll also use Cycle.js - a \nmodern, fully reactive web framework - to make a whole new breed of web applications.</p><p>By the end of the book, you'll know how to apply reactive programming to solve \ncomplex problems, build efficient programs with reactive user interfaces, and write \nyour code more declaratively.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>A modern web browser, Node.JS installed in your computer, and the RxJS JavaScript \nlibrary.</p></span>",

It goes through creating Observables, transforming, filtering, and combining them, and concurrency and testing to finish with extending the library itself.</p><p>This book is a definite tutorial in RxJava filled with a lot of well-described examples. It explains reactive programming concepts in plain and readable language, without scientific formulas and terms.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Discover what reactive programming is and how you can benefit from it</li><li>Get to grips with the new functional features of Java 8 and some functional theory</li><li>Create RxJava Observable instances from virtually any data source</li><li>Transform, filter, and accumulate your data using various RxJava operators</li><li>Combine multiple data sources in one dataset, using custom logic</li><li>Write concurrent programs with ease, scheduling actions on various workers</li><li>Learn about unit testing asynchronous RxJava logic</li><li>Extend RxJava by writing your own operators and factory methods</li></ul></span>",

			"title": "Beginning Reactive Programming with Swift: Using RxSwift, Amazon Web Services, and JSON with iOS and macOS",
			"description": "<span><p>Learn the basics of reactive programming and how it makes apps more responsive. This book shows you how to incorporate reactive programming into existing development products and cycles using RXSwift and RXCocoa on iOS and Mac.<br/></p><p>As we move away from the traditional paradigm of typing or touching one step at a time to interact with programs, users expect apps to adapt and not need constant hand-holding. People today expect their devices to do much more than just follow commands. They expect devices to react and adapt. Reactive programming, a new term for asynchronous processing, requires new app architectures, and you'll learn how these are already built into iOS and macOS in many places.   </p><p>As part of this more complex environment, you'll move beyond Cocoa and Cocoa Touch to incorporate data from Amazon Web Services (AWS), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and other formats, and standards. Together with the concepts of reactive programming and RxSwift, these tools help you build more powerful and useful apps that have wide appeal and use.</p><p><b>What You'll Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Work with tools such as Darwin microkernel, RxSwift, and RxCocoa<br/></li><li>Use Git repositiories and other resoucrces to get into coding<br/></li><li>Create apps that adapt to gestures and UI interaction as well as what's happening in and around the environment of the app itself.<br/></li></ul><p></p><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div> This book is for Swift programmers interested in learning to create reactive apps with RxSwift.    <b><br/></b></div><p></p><p> </p><p></p></span>",
