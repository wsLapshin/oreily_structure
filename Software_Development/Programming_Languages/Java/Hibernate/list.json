You'll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate, working through mappings, queries, fetching strategies, transactions, conversations, caching, and more. Along the way you'll find a well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design and optimization techniques. In this revised edition, authors Christian Bauer, Gavin King, and Gary Gregory cover Hibernate 5 in detail with the Java Persistence 2.1 standard (JSR 338). All examples have been updated for the latest Hibernate and Java EE specification versions.\n  \n  </span>",

Good knowledge and understanding of Java is preferred to allow efficient programming of the core elements and applications; it would be helpful if readers are familiar with the basics of SQL.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Set up and install Hibernate on your system and explore different ways in which Hibernate can be configured</li><li>Learn the basic concepts and fundamentals of Java Hibernate</li><li>Define mappings without a use of XML file using Annotations</li><li>Persist collection elements such as list, map, set and array</li><li>Explore the various mapping options and learn to work with Hibernate associations</li><li>Understand advanced Hibernate concepts such as caching and inheritance</li><li>Develop an engaging and robust real-world hibernate application based on a common business scenario</li><li>Integrate Hibernate with other frameworks to develop robust enterprise applications</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Hibernate is a database independent technology, so the same code will work for all databases. It helps a Java developer write a query by mapping Java bean to database tables and help create tuned queries that boost performance. Even with limited SQL knowledge one can easily perform database operations. This makes the development faster and more accurate than JDBC. Hibernate supports useful features like connection pooling, caching, and inheritance etc.</p><p>This book will provide a useful hands-on guide to Hibernate to accomplish the development of a real-time Hibernate application.</p><p>We will start with the basics of Hibernate, which include setting up Hibernate ? the pre-requisites and multiple ways of configuring Hibernate using Java. We will then dive deep into the fundamentals of Hibernate such as SessionFactory, session, criteria, working with objects and criteria. This will help a developer have a better understanding of how Hibernate works and what needs to be done to run a Hibernate application. Moving on, we will learn how to work with annotations, associations and collections. In the final chapters, we will see explore querying, advanced Hibernate concepts and integration with other frameworks.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book is a practical guide filled with carefully organized step-by-step instructions. All recipes are arranged in an easy-to understand and clear manner allowing you to apply the solutions to other situations.</p></span>",

			"title": "Harnessing Hibernate",
			"description": "<span><div><p><em>Harnessing Hibernate</em> is an ideal introduction to the popular framework that lets Java developers work with information from a relational database easily and efficiently. Databases are a very different world than Java objects, and they often involve people with different skills and specializations. With Hibernate, bridging these two worlds is significantly easier, and with this book, you can get up to speed with Hibernate quickly.<br/><br/>Rather than present you with another reference, <em>Harnessing Hibernate</em> lets you explore the system, from download and configuration through a series of projects that demonstrate how to accomplish a variety of practical goals. The new edition of this concise guide walks you through Hibernate's primary features, which include mapping from Java classes to database tables, and from Java data types to SQL data types. You will also learn about Hibernate's data query and retrieval facilities, and much more.<br/><br/>By reading and following along with the examples, you can get your own Hibernate environment set up quickly and start using it for real-world tasks right away. <em>Harnessing Hibernate</em> teaches you how to:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>Perform Object/Relational mapping</li><li>Work with persistent data from Java code</li><li>Work with groups and relationships between objects</li><li>Extend Hibernate's rich type support for your own needs</li><li>Simplify query creation using criteria and examples</li><li>Use the Hibernate Query Language (HQL) and understand how it differs from SQL</li><li>Use Hibernate in conjunction with Spring</li><li>Use Hibernate in conjunction with other packages, such as the Stripes web framework and the Eclipse IDE</li></ul><p>Once you're past the first few chapters, you can jump to topics that you find particularly interesting or relevant. All background material and explanations of how Hibernate works and why is in the service of a focused task. Source code can be downloaded from the book's website.<br/><br/>If using SQL is an uncomfortable chore, <em>Harnessing Hibernate</em> offers you an effective and trouble-free method for working with the information you store in your applications.</p></div></span>",

Database\nexperts may enjoy fiddling with SQL, but you don't have to--the\nrest of the application is the fun part. And even database experts\ndread the tedious plumbing and typographical spaghetti needed to\nput their SQL into a Java program. <em>Hibernate: A Developers\nNotebook</em> shows you how to use Hibernate to automate\npersistence: you write natural Java objects and some simple\nconfiguration files, and Hibernate automates all the interaction\nbetween your objects and the database. You don't even need to know\nthe database is there, and you can change from one database to\nanother simply by changing a few statements in a configuration\nfile. <em>Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook</em> walks you through\nthe ins and outs of using Hibernate, from installation and\nconfiguration, to complex associations and composite types. Two\nchapters explore ways to write sophisticated queries, which you can\nexpress either through a pure Java API, or with an SQL-inspired,\nbut object-oriented, query language. Don't let that intimidate you\nthough: one of the biggest surprises in working with Hibernate is\nthat for many of the common real-world application scenarios, you\ndon't need an explicit query at all. If you've needed to add a\ndatabase backend to your application, don't put it off. It's much\nmore fun than it used to be, and <em>Hibernate: A Developer's\nNotebook</em> shows you why. Here's what a few reviewers had to say:\n\"I'm sitting on an airplane after finishing <em>Hibernate: A\nDeveloper's Notebook</em>. It's rare to find a book on a new Java\ntechnology that you can get through on a domestic flight. That this\nnotebook effectively and succinctly tackles object-relational\nmapping makes it, and Hibernate, even more impressive. Many books\nin this category would need to be checked luggage. With this book,\nyou travel first class.\" --Mike Clark \"A simple persistence\nframework deserves a simple book, and this one delivers. The\nexamples are well described and easy to understand, yet\nsophisticated enough to demonstrate Hibernate in a real-world\ncontext. Jim, I'm a new fan.\" --Bruce Tate About the new\nDeveloper's Notebook Series from O'Reilly: Developer's Notebooks\nare a new book series covering important new tools for software\ndevelopers. Developer's Notebooks stress example over explanation\nand practice over theory. They are about learning by doing; by\nexperimenting with tools and discovering what works. \"All lab, no\nlecture,\" with a thoughtful lab partner to guide the way.\n</p></span></span></span>",
