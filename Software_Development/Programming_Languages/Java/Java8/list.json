			"description": "<span><span><p/><p><em>Beginning Java 8 Language Features</em> covers essential and advanced features of the Java programming language such as the new lambda expressions (closures), inner classes, threads, I/O, Collections, garbage collection, streams, and more. Author Kishori Sharan provides over 60 diagrams and 290 complete programs to help you visualize and better understand the topics covered in this book.</p><p>The book starts with a series of chapters on the essential language features provided by Java, including annotations, inner classes, reflection, and generics. These topics are then complemented by details of how to use lambda expressions, allowing you to build powerful and efficient Java programs. The chapter on threads follows this up and discusses everything from the very basic concepts of a thread to the most advanced topics such as synchronizers, the fork/join framework, and atomic variables.</p><p>This book contains unmatched coverage of Java I/O, including NIO 2.0, the Path API, the FileVisitor API, the watch service and asynchronous file I/O. With this in-depth knowledge, your data- and file-management programs will be able to take advantage of every feature of Java's powerful I/O framework.</p><p>Finally, you'll learn how to use the Stream API, a new, exciting addition to Java 8, to perform aggregate operations on collections of data elements using functional-style programming. You'll examine the details of stream processing such as creating streams from different data sources, learning the difference between sequential and parallel streams, applying the filter-map-reduce pattern, and dealing with optional values.</p></span></span>",

All the sub-tasks are combined together once the required results are achieved; they are then merged to get the final output. The whole process is very complex. This process goes from the design of concurrent algorithms to the testing phase where concurrent applications need extra attention. Java includes a comprehensive API with a lot of ready-to-use components to implement powerful concurrency applications in an easy way, but with a high flexibility to adapt these components to your needs.</p><p>The book starts with a full description of design principles of concurrent applications and how to parallelize a sequential algorithm. We'll show you how to use all the components of the Java Concurrency API from basics to the most advanced techniques to implement them in powerful concurrency applications in Java.</p><p>You will be using real-world examples of complex algorithms related to machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, image processing in client / server environments. Next, you will learn how to use the most important components of the Java 8 Concurrency API: the Executor framework to execute multiple tasks in your applications, the phaser class to implement concurrent tasks divided into phases, and the Fork/Join framework to implement concurrent tasks that can be split into smaller problems (using the divide and conquer technique). Toward the end, we will cover the new inclusions in Java 8 API, the Map and Reduce model, and the Map and Collect model. The book will also teach you about the data structures and synchronization utilities to avoid data-race conditions and other critical problems. Finally, the book ends with a detailed description of the tools and techniques that you can use to test a Java concurrent application.</p><p><b>Style and approach </b></p><p>A complete guide implementing real-world examples with algorithms related to machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing in client/server environments. All the examples are explained in a step-by-step approach.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

If you’re an experienced developer looking to adopt Java 8 at work, this short guide will walk you through all of the major changes before taking a deep dive into lambda expressions and Java 8’s other big feature: the Streams API.</p><p>Author Raoul-Gabriel Urma explains how improved code readability and support for multicore processors were the prime movers behind Java 8 features. He’ll quickly get you up to speed on new classes including CompleteableFuture and Optional, along with enhanced interfaces and the new Date and Time API. You’ll also:</p><ul><li>Understand why lambda expressions are considered a kind of anonymous function</li><li>Learn how lambda expressions and the behavior parameterization pattern let you write flexible and concise code</li><li>Discover various operations and data processing patterns possible when using the Streams API</li><li>Use Collector recipes to write queries that are more sophisticated</li><li>Consider factors such as data size and the number of cores available when using streams in parallel</li><li>Work with a practical refactoring example to bring lambda expressions and streams into focus</li></ul></div></span>",

By learning topics such as classes, objects, interfaces, and inheritance you'll have a good understanding of Java's object-oriented model.</p><p>The final collection of topics takes what you've learned and turns you into a real Java programmer. You'll see how to take the power of object-oriented programming and write programs that can handle errors and exceptions, process strings and dates, format data, and work with arrays to manipulate data.</p></span>",

Each chapter starts with an introduction to the topic at hand, followed by a step-by-step discussion of the topic with small snippets of code. The book contains numerous figures aiding readers in visualizing the GUI that is built at every step in the discussion.</p><p>The book starts with an introduction to JavaFX and its history. It lists the system requirements and the steps to start developing JavaFX applications. It shows you how to create a Hello World application in JavaFX, explaining every line of code in the process. Later in the book, author Kishori Sharan discusses advanced topics such as 2D and 3D graphics, charts, FXML, advanced controls, and printing. Some of the advanced controls such as TableView, TreeTableView and WebView are covered at length in separate chapters.</p><p>This book provides complete and comprehensive coverage of JavaFX 8 features; uses an incremental approach to teach JavaFX, assuming no prior GUI knowledge; includes code snippets, complete programs, and pictures; covers MVC patterns using JavaFX; and covers advanced topics such as FXML, effects, transformations, charts, images, canvas, audio and video, DnD, and more. So, after reading and using this book, you'll come away with a comprehensive introduction to the JavaFX APIs as found in the new Java 8 platform. </p></span></span>",
