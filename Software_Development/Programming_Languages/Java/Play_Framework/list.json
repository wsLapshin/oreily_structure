			"description": "<span><p>Being that pharmacokinetics (PK) is the study of how the body handles various substances, it is not surprising that PK plays an important role in the early development of new drugs. However, the clinical research community widely believes that mathematics in some way blurs the true meaning of PK. Demonstrating that quite the opposite is true, Computational Pharmacokinetics outlines the fundamental concepts and models of PK from a mathematical perspective based on clinically relevant parameters. </p><p>After an introductory chapter, the book presents a noncompartmental approach to PK and discusses the numerical analysis of PK data, including a description of an absorption process through numerical deconvolution. The author then builds a simple physiological model to better understand PK volumes and compares this model to other methods. The book also introduces compartmental models, discusses their limitations, and creates a general-purpose type of model. The final chapter looks at the relationship between drug concentration and effect, known as PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) modeling.</p><p>With both a solid discussion of theory and the use of practical examples, this book will enable readers to thoroughly grasp the computational factors of PK modeling. </p></span>",

It is characterized by its simplicity and scalability.</p><p>With its lightweight, stateless, and web-friendly architecture, Play focuses on developer experience to make web application development fun.</p><p>Instant Play Framework Starter is the ideal companion to start developing web applications with Play. The building blocks of a typical web application are carefully designed following an on-going example.</p><p>Instant Play Framework Starter starts with a quick setup and running a first sample. Then, the anatomy of a typical Play application is outlined. More features are added step by step to an example application. The result is the prototype of a highly scalable web application.The example is implemented in Java and in Scala. It consists of building blocks you will find in every Play application. In particular, you will learn how views are rendered with the template engine, how HTTP routes are used to define the navigation rules, and how to separate the application logic of controllers from the business logic of the model. This separation is the result of a careful application design, which makes it easy to add features like data binding and validation. Finally you will see how easy it is to adapt different database access libraries.</p><p>Instant Play Framework Starter will help you to get started with Play and develop your first application. Packed with examples, it is easy to follow the design of a real-world application. You are able to compare the difference between a Java- and a Scala-based Play application and to decide which language fits your needs best. All topics covered in the book are described with the aim to serve as a reference for future web application development with Play.</p></span>",
