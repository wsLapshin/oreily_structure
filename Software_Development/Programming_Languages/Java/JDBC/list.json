			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nJava and databases make a powerful combination. Getting the two\nsides to work together, however, takes some effort--largely because\nJava deals in objects while most databases do not.\n</p><p>This book describes the standard Java interfaces that make\nportable object-oriented access to relational databases possible\nand offers a robust model for writing applications that are easy to\nmaintain. It introduces the JDBC and RMI packages and uses them to\ndevelop three-tier applications (applications divided into a user\ninterface, an object-oriented logic component, and an information\nstore).</p><p>The book begins with a quick overview of SQL for developers who\nmay be asked to handle a database for the first time. It then\nexplains how to issue database queries and updates through SQL and\nJDBC. It also covers the use of stored procedures and other\nmeasures to improve efficiency, where these are available.</p><p>But the book's key contribution is a set of patterns that let\ndevelopers isolate critical tasks like object creation, information\nstorage and retrieval, and the committing or aborting of\ntransactions.</p><p>The second edition includes more basics of JDBC and SQL, with\nmore examples, and a deeper discussion about the architecture of a\nrobust, maintainable database application. The second edition also\nexplains the relationship between JDBC and Enterprise\nJavaBeans.</p></span></span></span>",

			"title": "WebLogic: The Definitive Guide",
			"description": "<span><span><div><p>BEA's WebLogic Server implements the full range of J2EE technologies, and includes many additional features such as advanced management, clustering, and web services. Widely adopted, it forms the core of the WebLogic platform, providing a stable framework for building scalable, highly available, and secure applications. In fact, in the long list of WebLogic's strengths and features, only one shortcoming stands out: the documentation that comes with the WebLogic server often leaves users clamoring for more information.<br/><br/><i>WebLogic: The Definitive Guide</i> presents a 360-degree view of the world of WebLogic. Providing in-depth coverage of the WebLogic server, the book takes the concept of \"definitive\" to a whole new level. Exhaustive treatment of the WebLogic server and management console answers any question that developers or administrators might think to ask. Developers will find a useful guide through the world of WebLogic to help them apply their J2EE expertise to build and manage applications. Administrators will discover all they need to manage a WebLogic-based setup. And system architects will appreciate the detailed analysis of the different system architectures supported by WebLogic, the overall organization of a WebLogic domain and supporting network infrastructure, and more.<br/><br/><i>WebLogic: The Definitive Guide</i> is divided into three sections that explore WebLogic and J2EE, Managing the WebLogic Environment, and WebLogic Enterprise APIs. Some of the topics covered in this comprehensive volume include:</p><ul><li>Building web applications on the WebLogic Server</li><li>Building and optimizing RMI applications</li><li>Using EJBs with WebLogic, including CMP entity beans</li><li>Packaging and deploying applications</li><li>Understanding WebLogic's support for clustering</li><li>Performance tuning and related configuration settings</li><li>Configuring WebLogic's SSL support</li><li>Maximizing WebLogic's security features</li><li>Building web services with XML</li><li>Using WebLogic's JMX services and MBeans</li></ul>Anyone who has struggled with mastering the WebLogic server will appreciate the thorough, clearly written explanations and examples in this book. <i>WebLogic: The Definitive Guide</i> is the definitive documentation for this popular J2EE application server.</div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>JDBC--the Java Database Connectivity specification--is a complex set of application programming interfaces (APIs) that developers need to understand if they want their Java applications to work with databases.  JDBC is so complex that even the most experienced developers need to refresh their memories from time to time on specific methods and details.  But, practically speaking, who wants to stop and thumb through a weighty tutorial volume each time a question arises?  The answer is the <i>JDBC Pocket Reference</i>, a data-packed quick reference that is both a time-saver and a lifesaver.The <i>JDBC Pocket Reference</i> offers quick look-ups for all methods of the standard JDBC classes.  These include concise reviews of the procedures for common JDBC tasks such as connecting to a database, executing stored procedures, executing DDL and the like.  You'll find documentation of the connect string formats for the most common databases, including Oracle, SQL-Server, and PostgreSQL.  You'll even find information on working with large objects, and on using SQL99 user defined datatypes to work with object-relational data. Searching for this sort of material through large tutorials is frustrating and a waste of time, but this pocket-sized book is easy to take anywhere and makes finding the information you need a snap.O'Reilly's Pocket References have become a favorite among developers everywhere.  By providing a wealth of important details in a concise, well-organized format, these handy books deliver just what you need to complete the task at hand. When you've reached a sticking point and need to get to the answer quickly, the new <i>JDBC Pocket Reference</i> is the book you'll want close at hand.</p></span>",
