This short book is your quick-start tutorial for learning to use Maven. It includes inconsistently immutable collections, better array construction, and more from the latest Maven version 3.6. This second edition covers the newest in today's most popular build tool for Java development and programming.  </p>\n\nYou'll learn all about Maven and how to set it up. Firstly, you’ll cover the Maven life cycle and how to effectively leverage it. Also, you'll see the basics of site plugins, generating Javadocs, test coverage/FindBugs reports, and version/release notes. Furthermore, you'll take advantage of Maven's archetypes to bootstrap new projects easily. Finally, you will learn how to integrate the Nexus repository manager with Maven release phases.<br/> <br/> <p></p>\n<p><b>What You Will Learn </b></p>\n<ul><li>Set up your basic project in      Maven</li><li>Create more advanced projects</li><li>Apply the Maven life cycle to      your build</li>  Work with Maven archetypes      and manage Maven releases  <li>Integrate with Jenkins, Eclipse,      and other IDEs</li>  Carry out debugging and password      encryption </ul> <p> </p>\n<p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>\n\nThose new to Maven or those who are familiar with Maven, but maybe not with the latest Maven 3.6 release. <p></p>\n<p> </p><br/><p></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>For too long, developers have worked on disorganized application projects, where every part seemed to have its own build system, and no common repository existed for information about the state of the project. Now there's help. The long-awaited official documentation to Maven is here.<br/><br/>Written by Maven creator Jason Van Zyl and his team at Sonatype, <em>Maven: The Definitive Guide</em> clearly explains how this tool can bring order to your software development projects. Maven is largely replacing Ant as the build tool of choice for large open source Java projects because, unlike Ant, Maven is also a project management tool that can run reports, generate a project website, and facilitate communication among members of a working team.<br/><br/>To use Maven, everything you need to know is in this guide. The first part demonstrates the tool's capabilities through the development, from ideation to deployment, of several sample applications -- a simple software development project, a simple web application, a multi-module project, and a multi-module enterprise project.<br/><br/>The second part offers a complete reference guide that includes:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>The POM and Project Relationships</li><li>The Build Lifecycle</li><li>Plugins</li><li>Project website generation</li><li>Advanced site generation</li><li>Reporting</li><li>Properties</li><li>Build Profiles</li><li>The Maven Repository</li><li>Team Collaboration</li><li>Writing Plugins</li><li>IDEs such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, ands NetBeans</li><li>Using and creating assemblies</li><li>Developing with Maven Archetypes</li></ul><p>Several sources for Maven have appeared online for some time, but nothing served as an introduction and comprehensive reference guide to this tool -- until now. <em>Maven: The Definitive Guide</em> is the ideal book to help you manage development projects for software, web applications, and enterprise applications. And it comes straight from the source.<br/><br/></p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Maven is a new project management and comprehension tool which provides an elegant way to share build logic across projects. In terms of capabilities, Maven is an improvement to Apache Ant-thanks to numerous plug-ins and built-in integration with unit testing frameworks such as JUnit. Tired of writing the same build logic for every project? Using Maven, you can leverage the experience of the community to avoid the tedious process of creating yet another build script for each new project.<i>Maven: A Developer's Notebook</i> begins by introducing you to the concept of project object model (POM), and then offers further details on the essential features of Maven. Like all titles in O'Reilly's Developer's Notebook series, this no-nonsense book skips the boring prose and cuts right to the chase.  It's an approach that forces you to get your hands dirty by working through a series of poignant labs-exercises that speak to you instead of at you.Plus, <i>Maven: A Developer's Notebook</i> is the first book on the subject to hit the market, so you know the information is fresh and timely.  If you're a Java programmer, you'll be armed with all the critical information you need to get up to speed on this powerful new build tool. You'll discover how Maven can help you:</p><ul><li>manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation, all from a central piece of information</li><li>break a complex project into a series of smaller subprojects</li><li>report on code quality, unit tests, code duplication, and project activity</li><li>create a custom  remote repository</li><li>build simple and complex plug-ins</li></ul>In the end, you'll find yourself spending less time working on your project's build system and more time working on your project's code.</div></span>",
