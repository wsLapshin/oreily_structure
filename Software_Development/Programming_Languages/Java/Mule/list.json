			"title": "Enterprise Service Bus",
			"description": "<span><p>Large IT organizations increasingly face the challenge of integrating various web services, applications, and other technologies into a single network.  The solution to finding a meaningful large-scale architecture that is capable of spanning a global enterprise appears to have been met in ESB, or Enterprise Service Bus.  Rather than conform to the hub-and-spoke architecture of traditional enterprise application integration products, ESB provides a highly distributed approach to integration, with unique capabilities that allow individual departments or business units to build out their integration projects in incremental, digestible chunks, maintaining their own local control and autonomy, while still being able to connect together each integration project into a larger, more global integration fabric, or grid.<i>Enterprise Service Bus</i> offers a thorough introduction and overview for systems architects, system integrators, technical project leads, and CTO/CIO level managers who need to understand, assess, and evaluate this new approach. Written by Dave Chappell, one of the best known and authoritative voices in the field of enterprise middleware and standards-based integration, the book drills down into the technical details of the major components of ESB, showing how it can utilize an event-driven SOA to bring a variety of enterprise applications and services built on J2EE, .NET, C/C++, and other legacy environments into the reach of the everyday IT professional.With <i>Enterprise Service Bus</i>, readers become well versed in the problems faced by IT organizations today, gaining an understanding of how current technology deficiencies impact business issues. Through the study of real-world use cases and integration patterns drawn from several industries using ESB--including Telcos, financial services, retail, B2B exchanges, energy, manufacturing, and more--the book clearly and coherently outlines the benefits of moving toward this integration strategy.  The book also compares ESB to other integration architectures, contrasting their inherent strengths and limitations.If you are charged with understanding, assessing, or implementing an integration architecture, <i>Enterprise Service Bus</i> will provide the straightforward information you need to draw your conclusions about this important disruptive technology.</p></span>",

Next, it\ntakes a close look at Mule's standard components and how you can\nroll out custom ones. The book closes with a set of chapters on the\nnuts and bolts of working with Mule.

			"description": "<span><p>\nMost modern business systems include independent applications\nthat exchange information with each other-a technique usually\ncalled enterprise integration. An architectural approach called the\nEnterprise Service Bus (ESB) offers developers a way to handle the\nmessages between those independent applications without creating a\nlot of custom code. While commercial ESB solutions can be quite\nexpensive to implement and maintain, a set of high-quality open\nsource ESB tools offer the same functionality at a substantially\nlower cost.\n<em>Open Source ESBs in Action</em> shows you how to implement and\nuse two open source ESB implementations: Mule and ServiceMix. The\nauthors introduce you to these freely-available ESB tools and\npresent practical examples of how to use them in real-world\nscenarios. You will learn how the various features of an ESB such\nas transformation, routing, security, connectivity and more can be\nimplemented using Mule and ServiceMix. You will also learn how to\nsolve common enterprise integration problems using a structured\napproach.\nBeyond simply learning how Mule and Service Mix work, you'll\nlearn the core techniques of ESB implementation such as Process\nChoreography, or the implementation of complex business processes\nthrough an ESB, and Service Orchestration, or exposing a set of\nservices as a single service. The book shows you the fundamentals\nof ESB-based event processing and Quality of Service concerns like\nsecurity, reliable delivery, and transaction management.\nWorking in integration projects is exciting, with new\ntechnologies and paradigms arriving every day. Open Source\ntechnologies like Mule and ServiceMix both offer lower-cost\nsolutions and a higher degree of innovation than commercial ESB\nimplementations. Open Source ESBs in Action will help you master\nESB-driven integration techniques quickly and will provide you with\nknowledge you need to work effectively with Mule and\nServiceMix.\n</p></span>",
