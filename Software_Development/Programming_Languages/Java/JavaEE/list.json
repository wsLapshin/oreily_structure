			"description": "<span><span><span><p>Looking to study up for the new J2EE 1.5 Sun Certified Web Component Developer (SCWCD) exam? <br/><br/>This book will get you way up to speed on the technology you'll know it so well, in fact, that you can pass the brand new J2EE 1.5 exam. If that's what you want to do, that is. Maybe you don't care about the exam, but need to use servlets and JSPs in your next project. You're working on a deadline. You're over the legal limit for caffeine. You can't waste your time with a book that makes sense only AFTER you're an expert (or worse, one that puts you to sleep).<br/><br/>Learn how to write servlets and JSPs, what makes a web container tick (and what ticks it off), how to use JSP's Expression Language (EL for short), and how to write deployment descriptors for your web applications. Master the c:out tag, and get a handle on exactly what's changed since the older J2EE 1.4 exam. You don't just pass the new J2EE 1.5 SCWCD exam, you'll understand this stuff and put it to work immediately.<br/><br/><i>Head First Servlets and JSP</i> doesn't just give you a bunch of facts to memorize; it drives knowledge straight into your brain. You'll interact with servlets and JSPs in ways that help you learn quickly and deeply. And when you're through with the book, you can take a brand-new mock exam, created specifically to simulate the real test-taking experience.</p></span></span></span>",

Authors Bauke Scholtz and Arjan Tijms take you through real-world examples that demonstrate how these new features are used with other APIs in Jakarta EE. You’ll see the new and exciting ways Jakarta Faces applications can use to communicate between a client and a server, such as using WebSockets, invoking bean methods directly from Ajax, executing client-side JavaScript when Ajax calls complete, and more</div><div><br/></div><div>Along the way you’ll broaden your knowledge of Faces components and web APIs best practices, and learn a great deal about the internals of Faces and the design decisions that have been made when building the Faces API. For example, you’ll see what artefacts are now CDI injectable, how CDI changed Faces internally, and what some of the caveats are when working with the CDI versions of a Faces artefact.</div><div><br/></div><div>Furthermore, you'll build an example application from scratch. After reading <i>The Definitive Guide to Jakarta Faces in Jakarta EE 10</i>, you'll be ready to build your own efficient and secure web applications.  </div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Leverage the new features in Jakarta Faces in Jakarta EE in your existing applications</li><li>Integrate Faces and CDI</li><li>Use the brand new Component Search Expression framework, which enables you to more easily locate components from your template</li><li>Extend the Component Search Expression framework with your own search operators</li><li>Work with the different ways of mapping requests to Faces, make your application use extension-less URLs, and programmatically inspect which resources are present in your application</li><li>Master the best practices for web application development and see which are obsolete</li></ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Existing JSF or Java developers who need to create a web UI.

			"title": "JavaServer Pages, 3rd Edition",
			"description": "<span><p>JavaServer Pages (JSP) has built a huge following since the release of JSP 1.0 in 1999, providing Enterprise Java developers with a flexible tool for the development of dynamic web sites and web applications. While new point releases over the years, along with the introduction of the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL), have incrementally improved the rough areas of the first version of the JSP specification, JSP 2.0 takes this technology to new heights.<i>JavaServer Pages</i>, Third Edition, is completely revised and updated to cover the JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1 specifications. It includes detailed coverage of the Expression Language (EL) incorporated into JSP 2.0, the JSTL 1.1 tag libraries and the new function library, the new tag file format that enables custom tag library development without Java code, the simplified Java tag library API, improvements in the JSP XML syntax, and more. Further, it details setup of the Apache Tomcat server, JSP and JSTL syntax and features, error handling and debugging, authentication and personalization, database access, XML processing, and internationalization.This book recognizes the different needs of the two groups of professionals who want to learn JSP: page authors interested in using JSP elements in web pages, and programmers concerned with learning the JSP API and using JSP effectively as a part of an enterprise application. If you're in the first group, you'll learn from the practical web application examples in the second part of the book. If you're in the latter group, you'll appreciate the detailed coverage of advanced topics in the third part, such as how to integrate servlets and JavaBeans components with JSP using the popular Apache Struts MVC framework, and how to develop custom tag libraries using the JSP API, with realistic examples that you can use as a springboard for your own libraries.\"Hans Bergsten, a JSP expert group veteran and one of our most active contributors, has thoroughly and accurately captured the new features of JSP 2.0 and JSTL 1.1 in a way that is well-organized and easy to understand. With excellent, to-the-point examples, this book is a 'must have' for any serious JSP 2.0 developer.\"--Mark Roth, JSP 2.0 Specification Lead, Sun Microsystems, Inc.Hans Bergsten is the founder of Gefion Software, a company focused on Java services and products based on J2EE technologies. Hans has been an active participant in the working groups for both the servlet and JSP specifications since their inception and contributes to other related JCP specifications, such as JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) and JavaServer Faces (JSF), and, as one of the initial members of the Apache Jakarta Project Management Committee, helped develop the Apache Tomcat reference implementation for the servlet and JSP specifications.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>What do Ford Financial, IBM, and Victoria's Secret have in common? Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).  As the industry standard for platform-independent reusable business components, EJB has just become Sun Microsystem's latest developer certification. Whether you want to be certifiable or just want to learn the technology inside and out, <i>Head First EJB</i> will get you there in the least painful way. And with the greatest understanding.You'll learn not just what the technology <em>is</em>, but more importantly, <em>why</em> it is, and what it is and isn't good for. You'll learn tricks and tips for EJB development, along with tricks and tips for passing this latest, very challenging Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD) exam. You'll learn how to think like a server. You'll learn how to think like a bean. And because this is a Head First book, you'll learn how to think about thinking.Co-author Kathy Sierra was one of Sun's first employees to teach brave, early adopter customers how to use EJB. She has the scars. But besides dragging you deep into EJB technology, Kathy and Bert will see you through your certification exam, if you decide to go for it. And nobody knows the certification like they do - they're co-developers of Sun's actual exam!As the second book in the Head First series, <i>Head First EJB</i> follows up the number one best-selling Java book in the US, <i>Head First Java</i>. Find out why reviewers are calling it a revolution in learning tough technical topics, and why Sun Chairman and CEO Scott McNealy says, \"Java technology is everywhere...if you develop software and haven't learned Java, it's definitely time to dive in \"Head First.\"And with Head First book, you don't even have to feel guilty about having fun while you're learning; it's all part of the learning theory. If the latest research in cognitive science, education, and neurobiology suggested that boring, dry, and excruciatingly painful was the best way to learn, we'd have done it. Thankfully, it's been shown that your brain has a sense of style, a sense of humour, and a darn good sense of what it likes and dislikes.In <i>Head First EJB</i>, you'll learn all about:</p><ul><li>Component-based and role-based development</li><li> The architecture of EJB, distributed programming with RMI</li><li>Developing and Deploying an EJB application</li><li>The Client View of a Session and Entity bean</li><li>The Session Bean Lifecycle and Component Contract</li><li>The Entity bean Lifecycle and Component Contract</li><li>Container-managed Persistence (CMP)</li><li>Container-managed Relationships (CMR)</li><li>EJB-QL</li><li>Transactions</li><li>Security</li><li>EJB Exceptions</li><li>The Deployment Descriptor</li><li>The Enterprise Bean Environment in JNDI</li><li>Programming Restrictions and Portability</li></ul>The book includes over 200 mock exam questions that match the tone, style, difficulty, and topics on the real SCBCD exam. See why Kathy and Bert are responsible for thousands of successful exam-passers--\"The Sun certification exam was certainly no walk in the park, but Kathy's material allowed me to not only pass the exam, but Ace it!\"--Mary Whetsel, Sr. Technology Specialist, Application Strategy and Integration, The St. Paul Companies\"Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates are two of the few people in the world who can make complicated things seem damn simple, and as if that isn't enough, they can make boring things seem interesting.\"--Paul Wheaton, The Trail Boss, javaranch.com\"Who better to write a Java study guide than Kathy Sierra, reigning queen of Java instruction? Kathy Sierra has done it again.  Here is a study guide that almost guarantees you a certification!\"--James Cubetta, Systems Engineer, SGI</div></span>",

Finding even one tested code \"recipe\" that solves a gnarly problem in this comprehensive collection of solutions and best practices will save hours of frustration--easily justifying the cost of this invaluable book.But \"Java Servlet and JSP Cookbook\" is more than just a wealth of cut-and-paste code. It also offers clear explanations of how and why the code works, warns of potential pitfalls, and directs you to sources of additional information, so you can learn to adapt the problem-solving techniques to similar situations.These recipes include vital topics like the use of Ant to setup a build environment, extensive coverage of the WAR file format and web.xml deployment descriptor, file-uploading, error-handling, cookies, logging, dealing with non-HTML content, multimedia, request filtering, web services, I18N, web services, and  a host of other topics that frustrate even the most seasoned developers.For Java web developers of all levels who are eager to put into practice the theory presented in other API-focused books, the solutions presented in this practical book will prove invaluable over and over again. This is painless way for less experienced developers who prefer to learn by doing to expand their skills and productivity, while accomplishing practical solutions to the pressing problems they face every day.  More experienced developers can use these recipes to solve time-consuming problems quickly, freeing up their time for the more creative aspects of their work.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>\nJavaServer Pages (JSP) technology provides an easy way to create\ndynamic web pages. JSP uses a component-based approach that allows\nweb developers to easily combine static HTML for look-and-feel with\nJava components for dynamic features. The simplicity of this\ncomponent-based model, combined with the cross-platform power of\nJava, allows a web development environment with enormous potential.\n<em>JavaServer Pages</em> shows how to develop Java-based web\napplications without having to be a hardcore programmer. The author\nprovides an overview of JSP concepts and discusses how JSP fits\ninto the larger picture of web applications. Web page authors will\nbenefit from the chapters on generating dynamic content, handling\nsession information, accessing databases, authenticating users, and\npersonalizing content. In the programming-oriented chapters, Java\nprogrammers learn how to create Java components and custom JSP tags\nfor web authors to use in JSP pages.\n</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><span><p>Built on top of the Java™ software infrastructure,\nJini™ technology enables all types of services and devices to\nwork together in a community--organized without extensive planning,\ninstallation, or human intervention. Jini technology allows the\nlines to blur between what is hardware and what is software by\nrepresenting all hardware and software as Jini technology-enabled\n\"services,\" accessible either directly or through surrogates\nwritten in the Java programming language. In a distributed system\nof Jini technology-enabled services, these programs interact\nspontaneously, enabling services to join or leave the network with\nease, which allows clients to view and access available services\nwith confidence. A system of Jini technology-enabled services can\nlink office components such as printers, faxes, and desktop\ncomputers. Beyond these traditional networks, the technology is\nalso ideal for building the home-based networks that are now\nemerging: entertainment systems, cars, smart houses, and personal\ncomputers.</p><p>This book contains the formal specification for the core Jini\ntechnology, as well as specifications for local helper utilities\nand remote helper services. It offers a review of distributed\ncomputing fundamentals, an overview of the Jini architecture, and\nan introduction to the key concepts that are the source of the\ntechnology's simplicity and power--remote objects, leasing,\ndistributed events, and a two-phase commit protocol. The formal\nspecifications provide the definitive description of every element\nof the Jini architecture, including detailed information on such\ntopics as:</p><li><p>Jini discovery and join protocols</p></li><li><p>Jini entry usage</p></li><li><p>Jini distributed leasing concepts</p></li><li><p>Jini distributed event programming model</p></li><li><p>Jini transaction model and semantics</p></li><li><p>Jini lookup service and lookup attribute schema</p></li><li><p>Jini discovery, event, leasing, and join utilities</p></li><li><p>Jini lookup discovery, lease renewal, and event mailbox helper\nservices</p></li><li><p>Jini device architecture</p></li><p><br/><br/>\n0201726173B04062001</p></span></span></span></span>",

With the help of Java EE 8 Microservices, you'll get to grips with the components of Java EE 8 and understand how they are used to implement microservices. This book explains how a monolithic application is transformed into a microservice application, then helps you connect it in a traditional way and use advanced approaches for asynchronous communication. Once you have learned the basics, you'll explore advanced topics to make your microservices robust, scalable, and secure. Microservices form distributed applications, and by the end of this book you'll have discovered how to develop, pack, ship, and support distributed applications using Java EE.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Build microservices from the ground up with Java EE 8\n</li><li>Implement and deploy microservices with Spring Boot\n</li><li>Develop reactive pipelines for asynchronous communication\n</li><li>Use caching mechanisms and JSON Web Token (JWT) to create scalable and secure microservices\n</li><li>Empower microservices with the Micro Profile effort and implement health checks, fault tolerance, and monitoring mechanisms\n</li><li>Use containers to build and deploy microservices\n</li><li>Create contract-first documentation with Swagger and API Blueprint\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>Java EE 8 Microservices is for Java EE developers keen to build microservice-based enterprise applications.</p></span>",

This practical, code-intensive guide provides best practices for using simpler and more effective methods and tools, including JavaServer pages, servlets, and lightweight frameworks.</p><p><b>What does this book cover?</b></p><p>The book begins by examining the limits of EJB technology -- what it does well and not so well. Then the authors guide you through alternatives to EJB that you can use to create higher quality applications faster and at lower cost -- both agile methods as well as new classes of tools that have evolved over the past few years.</p><p>They then dive into the details, showing solutions based on the lightweight framework they pioneered on SourceForge -- one of the most innovative open source communities. They demonstrate how to leverage practical techniques and tools, including the popular open source Spring Framework and Hibernate. This book also guides you through productive solutions to core problems, such as transaction management, persistence, remoting, and Web tier design. You will examine how these alternatives affect testing, performance, and scalability, and discover how lightweight architectures can slash time and effort on many projects.</p><p><b>What will you learn from this book?</b></p><p>Here are some details on what you'll find in this book:</p><ul><li><p>How to find the simplest and most maintainable architecture for your application</p></li><li><p>Effective transaction management without EJB</p></li><li><p>How to solve common problems in enterprise software development using AOP and Inversion of Control</p></li><li><p>Web tier design and the place of the Web tier in a well-designed J2EE application</p></li><li><p>Effective data access techniques for J2EE applications with JDBC, Hibernate, and JDO</p></li><li><p>How to leverage open source products to improve productivity and reduce custom coding</p></li><li><p>How to design for optimal performance and scalability</p></li></ul></span></span>",

In fact, EJB 3.0 is being hailed as the new standard of server-side business logic programming. And O'Reilly's award-winning book on EJB has been refreshed just in time to capitalize on the technology's latest rise in popularity.</p><p>This fifth edition, written by Bill Burke and Richard Monson-Haefel, has been updated to capture the very latest need-to-know Java technologies in the same award-winning fashion that drove the success of the previous four strong-selling editions. Bill Burke, Chief Architect at JBoss, Inc., represents the company on the EJB 3.0 and Java EE 5 specification committees. Richard Monson-Haefel is one of the world's leading experts on Enterprise Java.</p><p><i>Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0</i>, 5th Edition is organized into two parts: the technical manuscript followed by the JBoss workbook. The technical manuscript explains what EJB is, how it works, and when to use it. The JBoss workbook provides step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running the examples from the manuscript on the JBoss 4.0 Application Server.</p><p>Although EJB makes application development much simpler, it's still a complex and ambitious technology that requires a great deal of time to study and master. But now, thanks to <i>Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0</i>, 5th Edition, you can overcome the complexities of EJBs and learn from hundreds of practical examples that are largeenough to test key concepts but small enough to be taken apart and explained in the detail that you need. Now you can harness the complexity of EJB with just a single resource by your side.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>JavaServer Faces, or JSF, brings a component-based model to web application development that's similar to the model that's been used in standalone GUI applications for years.  The technology builds on the experience gained from Java Servlets, JavaServer Pages, and numerous commercial and open source web application frameworks that simplify the development process.In <i>JavaServer Faces</i>, developers learn how to use this new framework to build real-world web applications. The book contains everything you'll need: how to construct the HTML on the front end; how to create the user interface components that connect the front end to your business objects; how to write a back-end that's JSF-friendly; and how to create the deployment descriptors that tie everything together.<i>JavaServer Faces</i> pays particular attention to simple tasks that are easily ignored, but crucial to any real application: working with tablular data, for example, or enabling and disabling buttons.  And this book doesn't hide from the trickier issues, like creating custom components or creating renderers for different presentation layers.  Whether you're experienced with JSF or a just starting out, you'll find everything you need to know about this technology in this book.Topics covered include:</p><ul><li>The JSF environment</li><li>Creating and rendering components</li><li>Validating input</li><li>Handling user-generated events</li><li>Controlling page navigation</li><li>Working with tabular data</li><li>Internationalization</li><li>Integration between JSF and Struts</li><li>Developing custom renderers and custom components</li></ul><i>JavaServer Faces</i> is a complete guide to the crucial new JSF technology.  If you develop web applications, JSF belongs in your toolkit, and this book belongs in your library.</div></span>",

It is efficient, abstracts popular DBMS, and supports PHP 5.3 features.</p><p>Doctrine is a must-have for modern PHP applications.</p><p>Persistence in PHP with Doctrine ORM is a practical, hands-on guide that describes the full creation process of a web application powered by Doctrine. Core features of the ORM are explained in depth and illustrated by useful, explicit, and reusable code samples.</p><p>Persistence in PHP with Doctrine ORM explains everything you need to know to get started with Doctrine in a clear and detailed manner.</p><p>From installing the ORM through Composer to mastering advanced features such as native queries, this book is a full overview of the power of Doctrine. You will also learn a bunch of mapping annotations, create associations, and generate database schemas from PHP classes. You will also see how to write data fixtures, create custom entity repositories, and issue advanced DQL queries. Finally it will teach you to play with inheritance, write native queries, and use built-in lifecycle events.

Seam is rapidly capturing the interest of Java\nenterprise developers because of its focus on simplicity, ease of\nuse, transparent integration, and scalability.\n<em>Seam in Action</em> offers a practical and in-depth look at\nJBoss Seam. The book puts Seam head-to-head with the complexities\nin the Java EE architecture. The author presents an unbiased view\nof Seam from outside the walls of RedHat/JBoss, focusing on such\ntopics as Spring integration and deployment to alternative\napplication servers to steer clear of vendor lock-in. By the end of\nthe book, you should expect to not only gain a deep understanding\nof Seam, but also come away with the confidence to teach the\nmaterial to others.\nTo start off, you will see a working Java EE-compliant\napplication come together by the end of the second chapter. As you\nprogress through the book, you will discover how Seam eliminates\nunnecessary layers and configurations, solves the most common JSF\npain points, and establishes the missing link between JSF, EJB 3\nand JavaBean components. The author also shows you how Seam opens\ndoors for you to incorporate technologies you previously have not\nhad time to learn, such as business processes and stateful page\nflows (jBPM), Ajax remoting, PDF generation, asynchronous tasks,\nand more.\nAll too often, developers spend a majority of their time\nintegrating disparate technologies, manually tracking state,\nstruggling to understand JSF, wrestling with Hibernate exceptions,\nand constantly redeploying applications, rather than on the logic\npertaining to the business at hand. <em>Seam in Action</em> dives\ndeep into thorough explanations of how Seam eliminates these\nnon-core tasks by leveraging configuration by exception, Java 5\nannotations, and aspect-oriented programming.\n</p></span>",

The essays appeal to a broad audience: the software developer will find thoughtful reflections on practices and methodology from leading open source developers like Jeremy Allison and Ben Laurie, while the business executive will find analyses of business strategies from the likes of Sleepycat co-founder and CEO Michael Olson and Open Source Business Conference founder Matt Asay.</p><p>From China, Europe, India, and Brazil we get essays that describe the developing world's efforts to join the technology forefront and use open source to take control of its high tech destiny. For anyone with a strong interest in technology trends, these essays are a must-read.</p><p>The enduring significance of open source goes well beyond high technology, however. At the heart of the new paradigm is network-enabled distributed collaboration: the growing impact of this model on all forms of online collaboration is fundamentally challenging our modern notion of community.</p><p>What does the future hold? Veteran open source commentators Tim O'Reilly and Doc Searls offer their perspectives, as do leading open source scholars Steven Weber and Sonali Shah.

			"description": "<span><span><p>\nThe new 2.1 version of the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) spec extends\nits support for web services and the Java Web Services APIs,\nexpands its asynchronous messaging support, adds XML Schema for\ndeployment descriptors, and introduces a new Timer service, which\nallows for scheduling EJB jobs. The essential--and award\nwinning--book on EJBs, <em>Enterprise JavaBeans</em>, has been\ncompletely revised and updated in this new fourth edition, to\nprovide the real-world, nitty-gritty detail developers need to\nmaster EJB 2.1. Previous editions of this clear and engaging\nintroduction to EJBs were voted the \"Best Java Book\" by the editors\nand readers of <em>Java Developer's Journal</em>, the \"Best Java Book\nfor Experts,\" by <em>JavaPro</em> editors, and one of the Top\nComputer Books by Amazon.com. The fourth edition lives up to--and\nsurpasses--the excellent reputation earned by its predecessors.\nThis authoritative and thorough guide includes everything that made\nprevious editions the single must-have book for EJB developers: the\nauthors solid grasp on the complexities of EJBs coupled with his\nsuccinct, easy-to-follow style; hundreds of clear, practical\nexamples; adept coverage the key concepts EJBs ; and diagrams to\nillustrate the concepts presented. It also includes everything you\nneed to get up to speed quickly on the changes wrought by EJB\nversion 2.1, an architecture overview, information on resource\nmanagement and primary services, design strategies, and XML\ndeployment descriptors. In this edition, we're adding an EJB\nworkbook for JBoss 4.0. The workbook shows how to deploy all of the\nexamples on the JBoss 4.0 application server. It addresses an\nimportant problem with EJB: deploying the software on a server can\nbe extremely difficult. JBoss is an open source project that has\nbecome the most widely used J2EE application server. Good technical\nauthors may lay the facts before you, but great ones offer the\ndistilled essence of their own experience and insight. Richard\nMonson-Haefel has provided just what Java developers need to know\nto harness the complexity of EJBs. What makes Monson-Haefel a\nmaster of technical authoring can be seen in his well-thought-out\nand logical progression of ideas, and in his examples practical,\nprecise, usable examples, large enough to test key concepts but\nstill small enough to be comprehensible taken apart and explained\nin the detail you need to deploy those principles in other\nsituations. If you work with EJBs--or want to--this book will earn\na favored spot on your bookshelf.\n</p></span></span>",

			"title": "JavaServer Pages, Second Edition",
			"description": "<span><span><p>\nSince its inception in 1999, Enterprise Java has taken the Java\nprogramming community by storm--developers have realized its\npotential for building distributed applications. Today, JavaServer\nPages (JSP) continues to harmonize how web designers and\nprogrammers create dynamic web sites. JSP builds on the popular\nJava servlet technology and makes it easier to develop dynamic web\napplications--even if you're not a hard-core programmer.\n<em>JavaServer Pages, 2nd Edition</em> is completely revised and\nupdated to cover the substantial changes in the 1.2 version of the\nJSP specification, and also includes detailed coverage of the new\nJSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL)--an eagerly anticipated\nspecification of a set of JSP elements for the tasks needed in most\nJSP applications. This book starts off by illustrating how JSP\ncapitalizes on the power of Java servlets to create effective,\nportable web applications. It shows how to get started using the\nApache Tomcat server, and provides detailed coverage of JSP syntax\nand features, error handling and debugging, authentication and\npersonalization, and how to use JSTL for database access, XML\nprocessing, and internationalization. <em>JavaServer Pages</em>\nrecognizes the different needs of the two groups of professionals\nwho want to learn JSP: page authors interested in using JSP\nelements in web pages, and programmers concerned with learning the\nJSP API and using JSP effectively in an enterprise application. If\nyou're in the latter group, this book also teaches you such\nadvanced topics as integrating servlets and JavaBeans with JSP,\nusing the popular Apache Struts MVC framework to illustrate how\nit's done. Finally, the author presents how to develop custom tag\nlibraries, using realistic examples that you can use as a\nspringboard for your own JSP libraries.\n</p><p>\"This is a complete, comprehensive, and most of all,\npractical book. The author excels at sharing his vast expertise so\nweb developers can make the most out of JavaServer Pages and\nrelated web technologies.\" --Pierre Delisle, JSP Standard Tag\nLibrary Specification Lead</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>\nEnterprise JavaBeans (versions 1.1 and 1.0) is an important\ntechnology for server-side application development in Java. It\noffers a component architecture for developing distributed,\nmultitiered enterprise applications. This model allows you to build\ncomplex, mission-critical systems using simple snap-together pieces\nthat model individual business objects and processes. Enterprise\nJavaBeans (EJB) greatly simplifies the process of development by\nautomatically taking care of system issues like object persistence\nand transaction management. This book provides a thorough\nintroduction to EJB 1.1 and 1.0 for the enterprise software\ndeveloper. It shows you how to develop enterprise Beans to model\nyour business objects and processes. One powerful advantage of the\nEJB architecture is that it allows you to partition work\nappropriately between different parts of the system: the database\nprovides persistence, your Beans model various business entities\nand the interactions between them, and your client application\nprovides a user interface, but incorporates minimal business logic.\nThe end result is a highly flexible system built from components\nthat can easily be reused, and that can be changed to suit your\nneeds without upsetting other parts of the system. <em>Enterprise\nJavaBeans, 2nd Edition</em> teaches you how to take advantage of the\nflexibility and simplicity that this powerful new architecture\nprovides.

			"description": "<span><span><span><p><em>JavaFX 2.0: Introduction by Example</em> provides a quick start to programming the JavaFX 2.0 platform. JavaFX 2.0 provides a rich set of APIs for use in creating graphically exciting client applications written solely in Java. You get a large set of customizable components that can be skinned using CSS techniques that you already know from doing web development. The platform even includes a web rendering engine enabling you to mix HTML content into your applications. Hardware acceleration means that your applications are fast and snappy, taking full advantage of modern graphics processing support at the hardware level. JavaFX 2.0 opens the door to business applications that look good, are fun to use, that take advantage of the medium to present data of all types—text, audio, video, etc.—in ways that engage the user and lead to increased productivity.</p><p>Getting started with JavaFX 2.0 is surprisingly easy. You already have the Java skills. Very likely you know enough of CSS to get by. All that's left is to get a leg up on the API, and that's where <em>JavaFX 2.0: Introduction by Example</em> can help. In this short book, author <b>Carl Dea</b> takes you through a series of engaging, fun-to-work examples that bring you up to speed on the major facets of the platform. Begin with the fundamentals of installing the software and creating a simple interface. Move in progressive steps through the process of developing a working dialog box for an application. Then let the fun begin as you explore images and animations, audio and video, and finally learn to embed JavaFX applications in a web page as well as embedding HTML5 content within an application. At the end of this book you'll have a good grasp of what JavaFX is all about, and you'll be ready to begin your journey towards mastery of the platform.</p><p>Entirely example-based</p><p>Focused on practical applications</p><p>Full of working code for you to adapt and extend</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><p>Install JavaFX 2.0 and configure your environment</p><p>Create applcations menus and dialog boxes</p><p>Design forms for data entry</p><p>Work with images and animations</p><p>Embed audio and video into your applications</p><p>Deploy JavaFX applications in a browser</p><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p><em>JavaFX 2.0: Introduction by Example</em> is aimed at Java programmers wanting to learn the JavaFX 2.0 platform for designing graphic- and media-rich client applications for the enterprise. Readers should be familiar with Java, and preferably also with the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment.</p></span></span></span>",

Programmers can also utilize this book to independently\ncreate new dynamic components. This second edition covers the\nlatest release of the JSP specification (2.0), many standard\nextensions to JSPs, and a number of best practices that have been\ndeveloped since the publication of the first edition.</p><p>This book also offers overviews of some related technologies,\nincluding:</p><li><p>JavaBeans™</p></li><li><p>Servlets</p></li><li><p>JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL)</p></li><li><p>Jakarta Struts</p></li><li><p>Databases</p></li><p><em><b>JavaServer Pages™, Second Edition</b></em> contains\nall the information necessary to start writing JSP--for anyone who\nhas a computer and can write HTML. It includes practical,\nJava-based techniques for maintaining and personalizing\ninformation-rich Web sites, as well as examples based on Jakarta\nStruts, the new JSP toolkit. Recent updates provide a number of new\ntools and techniques that will allow readers to get the most\nproductivity from JSPs, with the least amount of effort.</p><p>Also included is a CD-ROM containing everything you need to get\nstarted. The tools, which are free, open-source, stable, secure,\nand run on pretty much every platform, are powerful enough to serve\neven a mid-sized Web site without problems. Contents of the CD-ROM\ninclude: Tomcat™, the open-source reference implementation of\nthe latest JSP and Servlet specification; useful libraries such as\nthe JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library (JSTL) and Struts;\nHsqldb, a self-contained, 100 percent pure Java database; all the\ncode examples from the book; and a number of Java beans, providing\nready-to-use components for many of the tasks frequently needed on\na dynamic Web page.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0321150791B06042003</p></span></span>",
