			"title": "Practical Vaadin: Developing Web Applications in Java",
			"description": "<span>Implement web applications in Java using the open-source Vaadin framework version 20 and later. This easy-to-follow book covers all the key concepts and steps to become competent with modern versions of Vaadin. The book covers everything from setting up the development environment to implementing advanced features such as Server Push and database connectivity. The book helps you become proficient in the Vaadin framework, prepare for Vaadin certifications, and shows you how to apply the power of the Java programming language in developing applications for the web.<div><br/></div><div><br/>Author Alejandro Duarte starts with an introduction to web development and its key technologies. He then describes and demonstrates how Vaadin simplifies web development by allowing you to implement web graphical user interfaces using the Java programming language without having to code in JavaScript or HTML. Once a solid foundation on the key web and Vaadin concepts is established, Duarte digs deeper into explaining layouts and user interface components such as combo boxes, dialogs, upload fields, and data grids. He also covers topics such as styling with CSS, data binding, client-side views implementation with TypeScript, and integration with Spring Boot and Jakarta EE.</div><div><br/></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>What You Will Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Build web applications in Java using Servlet technology and Vaadin</li><li>Combine layouts and user interface components to create views in Java</li><li>Connect values in UI components to Java objects in the server through data binding<br/></li><li>Customize display styles and add responsive capabilities using CSS</li><li>Display tabular data using the Grid component</li><li>Implement client-side views using TypeScript<br/></li><li>Integrate Vaadin applications with Spring Boot and Jakarta EE</li><li>Connect Vaadin applications to SQL databases</li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Developers with a basic or higher knowledge of Java programming who want to build on their Java skills to create web graphical user interfaces, Java developers who want to create web applications without having to code in JavaScript, and developers who are preparing to take and pass Vaadin certification exams<br/></div></span>",
