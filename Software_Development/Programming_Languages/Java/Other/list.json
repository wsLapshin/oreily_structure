Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.\"</p><p>--Martin Buchholz</p><p>JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems</p><p>\"For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore’s Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl’s Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. <em><strong>Java Concurrency in Practice</strong></em> provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today’s--and tomorrow’s--systems.\"</p><p>--Doron Rajwan</p><p>Research Scientist, Intel Corp</p><p>\"This is the book you need if you’re writing--or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If you’ve ever had to synchronize a method and you weren’t sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.\"</p><p>--Ted Neward</p><p>Author of <em>Effective Enterprise Java</em></p><p>\"Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance.\"</p><p>--Kirk Pepperdine</p><p>CTO, <a href=\"http://JavaPerformanceTuning.com\">JavaPerformanceTuning.com</a></p><p>\"This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual.

As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In <em><strong>Java Concurrency in Practice</strong></em>, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them.</p><p>However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. <strong><em>Java Concurrency in Practice</em></strong> arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant.</p><p>This book covers:</p><ul><li><p>Basic concepts of concurrency and thread safety</p></li><li><p>Techniques for building and composing thread-safe classes</p></li><li><p>Using the concurrency building blocks in java.util.concurrent</p></li><li><p>Performance optimization dos and don’ts</p></li><li><p>Testing concurrent programs</p></li><li><p>Advanced topics such as atomic variables, nonblocking algorithms, and the Java Memory Model</p></li></ul></div></span>",

			"title": "Head First Java, 2nd Edition",
			"description": "<span><span><p>Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java.  You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study. <br/><br/>The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. <br/><br/>That's how your brain knows.<br/><br/>And that's how your brain will learn Java. <i>Head First Java</i> combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java.  You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI.  And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform.  Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required.  So learning the Head First way is more important than ever. <br/><br/>If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.<br/><br/>By exploiting how your brain works, <i>Head First Java</i> compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information.  Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><i>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, Second Edition</i> is designed to be easy to read and understand although the topic itself is complicated. Algorithms are the procedures that software programs use to manipulate data structures. Besides clear and simple example programs, the author includes a workshop as a small demonstration program executable on a Web browser. The programs demonstrate in graphical form what data structures look like and how they operate. In the second edition, the program is rewritten to improve operation and clarify the algorithms, the example programs are revised to work with the latest version of the Java JDK, and questions and exercises will be added at the end of each chapter making the book even more useful.</p><p>Educational Supplement</p><p>Suggested solutions to the programming projects found at the end of each chapter are made available to instructors at recognized educational institutions. This educational supplement can be found at <a href=\"http://www.prenhall.com/\">www.prenhall.com</a>, in the Instructor Resource Center.</p></span>",

This specification is based on a reactive programming paradigm, enabling developers to build enterprise-grade, robust applications with reduced complexity and in less time. Hands-On Reactive Programming with Reactor shows you how Reactor works, as well as how to use it to develop reactive applications in Java.\n</p><p>The book begins with the fundamentals of Reactor and the role it plays in building effective applications. You will learn how to build fully non-blocking applications and will later be guided by the Publisher and Subscriber APIs. You will gain an understanding how to use two reactive composable APIs, Flux and Mono, which are used extensively to implement Reactive Extensions. All of these components are combined using various operations to build a complete solution. \n</p><p>In addition to this, you will get to grips with the Flow API and understand backpressure in order to control overruns. You will also study the use of Spring WebFlux, an extension of the Reactor framework for building microservices.\n</p><p>By the end of the book, you will have gained enough confidence to build reactive and scalable microservices.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Explore benefits of the Reactive paradigm and the Reactive Streams API\n</li><li>Discover the impact of Flux and Mono implications in Reactor\n</li><li>Expand and repeat data in stream processing\n</li><li>Get to grips with various types of processors and choose the best one\n</li><li>Understand how to map errors to make corrections easier\n</li><li>Create robust tests using testing utilities offered by Reactor\n</li><li>Find the best way to schedule the execution of code\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you're looking to develop event- and data-driven applications easily with Reactor, this book is for you. Sound knowledge of Java fundamentals is necessary to understand the concepts covered in the book.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

It teaches youeverything you need to know about the collections libraries, so you'llalways know which collection is appropriate for any given task, andhow to use it.</p><p>Topics covered include:</p><ul><li>Fundamentals of generics: type parameters and generic methods</li><li>Other new features: boxing and unboxing, foreach loops, varargs</li><li>Subtyping and wildcards</li><li>Evolution not revolution: generic libraries with legacy clients andgeneric clients with legacy libraries</li><li>Generics and reflection</li><li>Design patterns for generics</li><li>Sets, Queues, Lists, Maps, and their implementations</li><li>Concurrent programming and thread safety with collections</li><li>Performance implications of different collections</li></ul><p>Generics and the new collection libraries they inspired take Java to anew level.  If you want to take your software development practice toa new level, this book is essential reading.</p><p><b>Philip Wadler</b> is Professor of Theoretical Computer Science at theUniversity of Edinburgh, where his research focuses on the design ofprogramming languages.  He is a co-designer of GJ, work thatbecame the basis for generics in Sun's Java 5.0.</p><p><b>Maurice Naftalin</b> is Technical Director at Morningside Light Ltd., a software consultancy in the United Kingdom.  He has most recently served as an architect and mentor at NSB Retail Systems plc, and as the leader of the client development team of a major UK government social service system.</p><p><i>\"A brilliant exposition of generics. By far the best book on thetopic, it provides a crystal clear tutorial that starts with thebasics and ends leaving the reader with a deep understanding of boththe use and design of generics.\"</i><br/>Gilad Bracha, Java Generics Lead, Sun Microsystems</p></div></span></span>",

			"title": "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code",
			"description": "<span><span><p>As the application of object\ntechnology--particularly the Java programming language--has become\ncommonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software\ndevelopment community. Significant numbers of poorly designed\nprograms have been created by less-experienced developers,\nresulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain\nand extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are\ndiscovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited,\n\"non-optimal\" applications. For several years, expert-level object\nprogrammers have employed a growing collection of techniques to\nimprove the structural integrity and performance of such existing\nsoftware programs. Referred to as \"refactoring,\" these practices\nhave remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been\nmade to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could\nuse. . .until now. In <em><b>Refactoring: Improving the Design of\nExisting Code,</b></em> renowned object technology mentor <b>Martin\nFowler</b> breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices\nand demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the\nsignificant benefits of this new process.</p><p>With proper training a skilled system\ndesigner can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed,\nrobust code. In this book, <b>Martin Fowler</b> shows you where\nopportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go\nabout reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step\nis simple--seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may\ninvolve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some\ncode out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even\npushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual\nsteps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small\nchanges can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven\nway to prevent software decay.</p><p>In addition to discussing the various\ntechniques of refactoring, the author provides a detailed catalog\nof more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that\nteach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for\napplying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the\nrefactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java,\nbut the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming\nlanguage.</p></span></span>",

Basic OOP Java programming experience and elementary familiarity with Java is expected.</p><b>What You Will Learn</b><ul><li>Understand the OOP and FP paradigms</li><li>Explore the traditional Java design patterns</li><li>Get to know the new functional features of Java</li><li>See how design patterns are changed and affected by the new features</li><li>Discover what reactive programming is and why is it the natural augmentation of FP</li><li>Work with reactive design patterns and find the best ways to solve common problems using them</li><li>See the latest trends in architecture and the shift from MVC to serverless applications</li><li>Use best practices when working with the new features</li></ul><b>In Detail</b><p>Having a knowledge of design patterns enables you, as a developer, to improve your code base, promote code reuse, and make the architecture more robust. As languages evolve, new features take time to fully understand before they are adopted en masse. The mission of this book is to ease the adoption of the latest trends and provide good practices for programmers.</p><p>We focus on showing you the practical aspects of smarter coding in Java. We'll start off by going over object-oriented (OOP) and functional programming (FP) paradigms, moving on to describe the most frequently used design patterns in their classical format and explain how Java's functional programming features are changing them.</p><p>You will learn to enhance implementations by mixing OOP and FP, and finally get to know about the reactive programming model, where FP and OOP are used in conjunction with a view to writing better code. Gradually, the book will show you the latest trends in architecture, moving from MVC to microservices and serverless architecture. We will finish off by highlighting the new Java features and best practices. By the end of the book, you will be able to efficiently address common problems faced while developing applications and be comfortable working on scalable and maintainable projects of any size.</p><b>Style and approach</b><p>This book explains design patterns in a step-by-step manner with clear and concise code explanations.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

This knowledge aids the Java developer in writing correct and complex performing multithreaded applications.</p><p>Java's thread APIs and concurrency utilities are among its most powerful and challenging APIs and language features. Java beginners typically find it very difficult to use these features to write correct multithreaded applications. Threads and the Concurrency Utilities helps all Java developers master and use these capabilities effectively.</p><p>This book is divided into two parts of four chapters each. Part 1 focuses on the Thread APIs and Part 2 focuses on the concurrency utilities. In Part 1, you learn about Thread API basics and runnables, synchronization and volatility, waiting and notification, and the additional capabilities of thread groups, thread local variables, and the Timer Framework. In Part 2, you learn about concurrency utilities basics and executors, synchronizers, the Locking Framework, and the additional capabilities of concurrent collections, atomic variables, and the Fork/Join Framework.</p><p>Each chapter ends with select exercises designed to challenge your grasp of the chapter's content. An appendix provides the answers to these exercises. A second appendix explores how threads are used by various standard class library APIs. Specifically, you learn about threads in the contexts of Swing, JavaFX, and Java 8's Streams API.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Java™ Design Patterns: A Tutorial",
			"description": "<span><span><p>Design patterns have become a staple of object-oriented design\nand programming by providing elegant, easy-to-reuse, and\nmaintainable solutions to commonly encountered programming\nchallenges. However, many busy Java programmers have yet to learn\nabout design patterns and incorporate this powerful technology into\ntheir work.</p><p><em><b>Java™ Design Patterns</b></em> is exactly the\ntutorial resource you need. Accessible and clearly written, it\nhelps you understand the nature and purpose of design patterns. It\nalso serves as a practical guide to using design patterns to create\nsophisticated, robust Java programs.</p><p>This book presents the 23 patterns cataloged in the flagship\nbook <em>Design Patterns</em> by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides.\nIn <em><b>Java™ Design Patterns,</b></em> each of these\npatterns is illustrated by at least one complete visual Java\nprogram. This practical approach makes design pattern concepts more\nconcrete and easier to grasp, brings Java programmers up to speed\nquickly, and enables you to take practical advantage of the power\nof design patterns.</p><p>Key features include:</p><li><p>Introductory overviews of design patterns, the Java Foundation\nClasses (JFC), and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)</p></li><li><p>Screen shots of each of the programs</p></li><li><p>UML diagrams illustrating interactions between the classes,\nalong with the original JVISION diagram files</p></li><li><p>An explanation of the Java Foundation Classes that illustrates\nnumerous design patterns</p></li><li><p>Case studies demonstrating the usefulness of design patterns in\nsolving Java programming problems</p></li><p>After reading this tutorial, you will be comfortable with the\nbasics of design patterns and will be able to start using them\neffectively in your day-to-day Java programming work.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201485397B04062001</p></span></span>",

Authors Kishori Sharan and Adam L. Davis walk you through writing your first Java program step-by-step. Armed with that practical experience, you'll be ready to learn the core of the Java language. <i>Beginning Java 17 Fundamentals</i> provides over 90 diagrams and 240 complete programs to help you learn the topics faster.</p><p>While this book teaches you the basics, it also has been revised to include the latest from Java 17 including the following: value types (records), immutable objects with an efficient memory layout; local variable type inference (var); pattern matching, a mechanism for testing and deconstructing values; sealed types, a mechanism for declaring all possible subclasses of a class; multiline text values; and switch expressions.</p><p>The book continues with a series of foundation topics, including using data types, working with operators, and writing statements in Java. These basics lead onto the heart of the Java language: object-oriented programming. By learning topics such as classes, objects, interfaces, and inheritance you'll have a good understanding of Java's object-oriented model. The final collection of topics takes what you've learned and turns you into a real Java programmer.</p><p>You'll see how to take the power of object-oriented programming and write programs that can handle errors and exceptions, process strings and dates, format data, and work with arrays to manipulate data. <br/></p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><p></p><ul><li>Write your first Java programs with emphasis on learning object-oriented programming</li><li>How to work with switch expressions, value types (records), local variable type inference, pattern matching switch and more from Java 17</li><li>Handle exceptions, assertions, strings and dates, and object formatting</li><li>Learn about how to define and use modules</li><li>Dive in depth into classes, interfaces, and inheritance in Java</li><li>Use regular expressions</li><li>Take advantage of the JShell REPL tool</li></ul><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Those who are new to Java programming, who may have some or even no prior programming experience.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>This book doesn't tell you how to write faster code, or how to write code with fewer memory leaks, or even how to debug code at all. What it does tell you is how to build your product in better ways, how to keep track of the code that you write, and how to track the bugs in your code. Plus some more things you'll wish you had known before starting a project.</p><p><i>Practical Development Environments</i> is a guide, a collection of advice about real development environments for small to medium-sized projects and groups. Each of the chapters considers a different kind of tool - tools for tracking versions of files, build tools, testing tools, bug-tracking tools, tools for creating documentation, and tools for creating packaged releases. Each chapter discusses what you should look for in that kind of tool and what to avoid, and also describes some good ideas, bad ideas, and annoying experiences for each area. Specific instances of each type of tool are described in enough detail so that you can decide which ones you want to investigate further.</p><p>Developers want to write code, not maintain makefiles. Writers want to write content instead of manage templates. IT provides machines, but doesn't have time to maintain all the different tools. Managers want the product to move smoothly from development to release, and are interested in tools to help this happen more often. Whether as a full-time position or just because they are helpful, all projects have toolsmiths: making choices about tools, installing them, and then maintaining the tools that everyone else depends upon.  This book is especially for everyone who ends up being a toolsmith for his or her group.</p></div></span>",

This book covers everything you need to know to get started with the platform, which has been engineered from the ground up for superior performance and cloud-native deployment.  </p>\n\nYou’ll start with an overview of the Quarkus framework and its features. Next, you'll dive into building your first microservice using Quarkus, including the use of JAX-RS, Swagger, Microprofile, REST, reactive programming, and more. You’ll see how to seamlessly add Quarkus to existing Spring framework projects. The book continues with a dive into the dependency injection pattern and how Quarkus supports it, working with annotations and facilities from both Jakarta EE CDI and the Spring framework. You’ll also learn about dockerization and serverless technologies to deploy your microservice. \n\n<p>Next you’ll cover how data access works in Quarkus with Hibernate, JPA, Spring Boot, MongoDB, and more. This will also give you an eye for efficiency with reactive SQL, microservices, and many more reactive components. You’ll also see tips and tricks not available in the official documentation for Quarkus. </p>\n<p>Lastly, you'll test and secure Quarkus-based code and use different deployment scenarios to package and deploy your Quarkus-based microservice for the cloud, using Amazon Web Services as a focus.

			"title": "Program Development in Java: Abstraction, Specification, and Object-Oriented Design",
			"description": "<span><p>Written by a world-renowned expert on\nprogramming methodology, and the winner of the 2008 Turing\nAward, this book shows how to build production-quality\nprograms--programs that are reliable, easy to maintain, and quick\nto modify. Its emphasis is on modular program construction: how to\nget the modules right and how to organize a program as a collection\nof modules. The book presents a methodology effective for either an\nindividual programmer, who may be writing a small program or a\nsingle module in a larger one; or a software engineer, who may be\npart of a team developing a complex program comprised of many\nmodules. Both audiences will acquire a solid foundation for\nobject-oriented program design and component-based software\ndevelopment from this methodology.</p><p>Because each module in a program corresponds\nto an abstraction, such as a collection of documents or a routine\nto search the collection for documents of interest, the book first\nexplains the kinds of abstractions most useful to programmers:\nprocedures; iteration abstractions; and, most critically, data\nabstractions. Indeed, the author treats data abstraction as the\ncentral paradigm in object-oriented program design and\nimplementation. The author also shows, with numerous examples, how\nto develop informal specifications that define these\nabstractions--specifications that describe what the modules do--and\nthen discusses how to implement the modules so that they do what\nthey are supposed to do with acceptable performance.</p><p>Other topics discussed include:</p><li><p>Encapsulation and the need for an implementation to provide the\nbehavior defined by the specification</p></li><li><p>Tradeoffs between simplicity and performance</p></li><li><p>Techniques to help readers of code understand and reason about\nit, focusing on such properties as rep invariants and abstraction\nfunctions</p></li><li><p>Type hierarchy and its use in defining families of related data\nabstractions</p></li><li><p>Debugging, testing, and requirements analysis</p></li><li><p>Program design as a top-down, iterative process, and design\npatterns</p></li><p>The Java programming language is used for\nthe book's examples. However, the techniques presented are language\nindependent, and an introduction to key Java concepts is included\nfor programmers who may not be familiar with the language.</p></span>",

Its abstractions can help you manage state in small to extremely large applications. However, if you are just starting out, it is essential to have a guide that can help you take the first steps. This book aims to be that guide that will equip you with the skills needed to use MobX and effectively handle the state management aspects of your application.\n</p><p>You will first learn about observables, actions, and reactions: the core concepts of MobX. To see how MobX really shines and simplifies state management, you'll work through some real-world use cases. Building on these core concepts and use cases, you will learn about advanced MobX, its APIs, and libraries that extend MobX.\n</p><p>By the end of this book, you will not only have a solid conceptual understanding of MobX, but also practical experience. You will gain the confidence to tackle many of the common state management problems in your own projects.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Explore the fundamental concepts of MobX, such as observables, actions, and reactions</li><li>Use observables to track state and react to its changes with validations and visual feedback (via React Components)</li><li>Create a MobX observable from different data types</li><li>Define form data as an observable state and tackle sync and async form validations</li><li>Use the special APIs to directly manipulate observables, tracking its changes, and discovering the reasons behind a change</li><li>Tackle any state management issue you may have in your app by combining mobx-utils and mobx-state-tree</li><li>Explore the internals of the MobX reactive system by diving into its inner workings</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for web developers who want to implement easy and scalable state management for their apps. Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is assumed \n</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

			"title": "Java Threads, 3rd Edition",
			"description": "<span><div><p>Threads are essential to Java programming, but learning to use them effectively is a nontrivial task. This new edition of the classic <i>Java Threads</i> shows you how to take full advantage of Java's threading facilities and brings you up-to-date with the watershed changes in Java 2 Standard Edition version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0). It provides a thorough, step-by-step approach to threads programming.Java's threading system is simple relative to other threading systems. In earlier versions of Java, this simplicity came with tradeoffs: some of the advanced features in other threading systems were not available in Java. J2SE 5.0 changes all that: it provides a large number of new thread-related classes that make the task of writing multithreaded programs that much easier.You'll learn where to use threads to increase efficiency, how to use them effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. This book discusses problems like deadlock, race conditions, and starvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden bugs.<i>Java Threads</i>, Third Edition, has been thoroughly expanded and revised. It incorporates the concurrency utilities from java.util.concurrent throughout. New chapters cover thread performance, using threads with Swing, threads and Collection classes, thread pools, and threads and I/O (traditional, new, and interrupted). Developers who cannot yet deploy J2SE 5.0 can use thread utilities provided in the Appendix to achieve similar functionality with earlier versions of Java.Topics include:</p><ul><li>Lock starvation and deadlock detection</li><li>Atomic classes and minimal synchronization (J2SE 5.0)</li><li>Interaction of Java threads with Swing, I/O, and Collection classes</li><li>Programmatically controlled locks and condition variables (J2SE 5.0)</li><li>Thread performance and security</li><li>Thread pools (J2SE 5.0)</li><li>Thread groups</li><li>Platform-specific thread scheduling</li><li>Task schedulers (J2SE 5.0)</li><li>Parallelizing loops for multiprocessor machines</li></ul>In short, this new edition of <i>Java Threads</i> covers everything you need to know about threads, from the simplest animation program to the most complex applications. If you plan to do any serious work in Java, you will find this book invaluable.Scott Oaks is a senior software engineer for the Java Performance Engineering group at Sun Microsystems and the author of four books in the O'Reilly Java series.Formerly a senior systems engineer at Sun Microsystems, Henry Wong is an independent consultant working on various Java related projects.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>More than ever, learning to program concurrency is critical to creating faster, responsive applications. Speedy and affordable multicore hardware is driving the demand for high-performing applications, and you can leverage the Java platform to bring these applications to life.<br/><br/>Concurrency on the Java platform has evolved, from the synchronization model of JDK to software transactional memory (STM) and actor-based concurrency. This book is the first to show you all these concurrency styles so you can compare and choose what works best for your applications. You'll learn the benefits of each of these models, when and how to use them, and what their limitations are.<br/><br/>Through hands-on exercises, you'll learn how to avoid shared mutable state and  how to write good, elegant, explicit synchronization-free programs so you can create easy and safe concurrent applications. The techniques you learn in this book will take you from dreading concurrency to mastering and enjoying it. Best of all, you can work with Java or a JVM language of your choice - Clojure, JRuby, Groovy, or Scala - to reap the growing power of multicore hardware.<br/><br/>If you are a Java programmer, you'd need JDK 1.5 or later and the Akka 1.0 library. In addition, if you program in Scala, Clojure, Groovy or JRuby you'd need the latest version of your preferred language. Groovy programmers will also need GPars.</p></span></span>",

The <em>Java Cookbook,</em> like\nthe bestselling <em>Perl Cookbook,</em> covers a lot of ground, and\noffers Java developers short, focused pieces of code that can be\neasily incorporated into other programs. The idea is to focus on\nthings that are useful, tricky, or both. The book includes code\nsegments covering many specialized APIs--like media and\nservlets--and should serve as a great \"jumping-off place\" for Java\ndevelopers who want to get started in areas outside of their\nspecialization. The book provides quick solutions to particular\nproblems that can be incorporated into other programs, but that\naren't usually programs in and of themselves.\n</p></span></span>",

Simply put, OSGi is a standardized technology that\nallows developers to create the highly modular Java applications\nthat are required for enterprise development. OSGi lets you\ninstall, start, stop, update, or uninstall components without\ntaking down your entire system. The interest in OSGibased\napplications has exploded since major vendors like Sun, Spring,\nOracle, BEA, and IBM have gotten behind the standard.\nOSGi in Action is a comprehensive guide to OSGi with two primary\ngoals. First, it provides a clear introduction to OSGi concepts\nwith examples that are relevant both for architects and developers.\nThen, it explores numerous practical scenarios and techniques,\nanswering questions like: How much of OSGi do you actually need?\nHow do you embed OSGi inside other containers?

			"description": "<span><span><p>\nThreads aren't a new idea: many operating systems and languages\nsupport them. But despite widespread support, threads tend to be\nsomething that everyone talks about, but few use. Programming with\nthreads has a reputation for being tricky and nonportable. Not so\nwith Java. Java's thread facilities are easy to use, and--like\neverything else in Java--are completely portable between platforms.\nAnd that's a good thing, because it's impossible to write anything\nbut the simplest applet without encountering threads. If you want\nto work with Java, you have to learn about threads. This new\nedition shows you how to take full advantage of Java's thread\nfacilities: where to use threads to increase efficiency, how to use\nthem effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. <em>Java\nThreads</em> discusses problems like deadlock, race condition, and\nstarvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden\nbugs. It brings you up to date with the latest changes in the\nthread interface for JDK 1.2. The book offers a thorough discussion\nof the Thread and ThreadGroup classes, the Runnable interface, the\nlanguage's synchronized operator. It explains thread scheduling\nends by developing a CPUSchedule class, showing you how to\nimplement your own scheduling policy. In addition, <em>Java\nThreads</em> shows you how to extend Java's thread primitives. Other\nextended examples include classes that implement reader/writer\nlocks, general locks, locks at arbitrary scope, and asynchronous\nI/O. This edition also adds extensive examples on thread pools,\nadvanced synchronization technique, like condition variables,\nbarriers, and daemon locks. It shows how to work with classes that\nare not thread safe, and pays special attention to threading issues\nwith Swing. A new chapter shows you how to write parallel code for\nmultiprocessor machines.

			"title": "Troubleshooting Java Performance: Detecting Anti-Patterns with Open Source Tools",
			"description": "<span>\n    Troubleshoot the most widespread and pernicious Java performance problems using a set of open-source and freely-available tools that will make you dramatically more productive in finding the root causes of slow performance. This is a brief book that focuses on a small number of performance anti-patterns, and you’ll find that most problems you encounter fit into one of these anti-patterns. The book provides a specific method in a series of steps referred to as the “P.A.t.h. Checklist” that encompasses persistence, alien systems, threads, and heap management. These steps guide you through a troubleshooting process that is repeatable, that you can apply to any performance problem in a Java application. This technique is especially helpful in 'dark' environments with little monitoring.<div><br/></div><div>Performance problems are not always localized to Java, but often fall into the realms of database access and server load. This book gives attention to both of these issues through examples</div> showing how to identify repetitive SQL, and identify architecture-wide performance problems ahead of production rollout.  Learn how to apply load like an expert, and determine how much load to apply to determine whether your system scales. Included are walk-throughs of a dozen server-side performance puzzles that are ready to run on your own machine. Following these examples helps you learn to:<div><ul><li>Assess the performance health of four main problems areas in a Java system: The P.A.t.h. Checklist presents each area with its own set of plug-it-in-now tools<br/></li><li>Pinpoint the code at fault for CPU and other bottlenecks without a Java profiler</li><li>Find memory leaks in just minutes using heapSpank, the author's open-source leak detector utility that is freely available from heapSpank.org</li></ul></div><div>The repeatable method provided in this book is an antidote to lackluster average response times that are multi-second throughout the industry. This book pro</div>vides a long absent, easy-to-follow, performance training regimen that will benefit anyone programming in Java. <div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Avoid the 6 most common ways to mess up a load test<br/></li><li>Determine the exact number of threads to dial into the load generator to test your system's scalability<br/></li><li>Detect the three most common SQL performance anti-patterns<br/></li><li>Measure network response times of calls to back-end systems ('alien systems')<br/></li><li>Identify whether garbage collection performance is healthy or unhealthy and whether delays are caused by problems in the old or new generation, so you know which generation needs to be adjusted<br/></li></ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Intermediate and expert Java developers and architects. Java experts will be able to update their skill set with the latest and most productive, open-source Java performance tools. Intermediate Java dev</div>elopers are exposed to the most common performance defects that repeatedly show up in Java applications, ones that account for the bulk of slow-performing systems.  Experts and intermediates alike will benefit from the chapters on load generation.\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>\nAll of Java's Input/Output (I/O) facilities are based on streams,\nwhich provide simple ways to read and write data of different\ntypes. Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its\nown application. The universe of streams is divided into four large\ncategories: input streams and output streams, for reading and\nwriting binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and\nwriting textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar\nwith the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a\nCipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream\nfor automatically compressing data? Do you know how to use buffered\nstreams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient?\n<em>Java I/O</em> tells you all you ever need to know about\nstreams--and probably more. A discussion of I/O wouldn't be\ncomplete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java\nsupports the UNICODE standard, which provides definitions for the\ncharacter sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the\nfirst programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any\nlanguage. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting\ntextual and numeric data. <em>Java I/O</em> shows you how to control\nnumber formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but\noutdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing\ntruly multilingual software. <em>Java I/O</em> includes:\n</p><ul><li><p>Coverage of all I/O classes and related classes</p></li><li><p>In-depth coverage of Java's number formatting facilities and\nits support for International character sets</p></li></ul></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>\nIn test driven development, you first write an executable test\nof what your application code must do. Only then do you write the\ncode itself and, with the test spurring you on, you improve your\ndesign. In acceptance test driven development (ATDD), you use the\nsame technique to implement product features, benefiting from\niterative development, rapid feedback cycles, and better-defined\nrequirements. TDD and its supporting tools and techniques lead to\nbetter software faster.\n<em>Test Driven</em> brings under one cover practical TDD\ntechniques distilled from several years of community experience.\nWith examples in Java and the Java EE environment, it explores both\nthe techniques and the mindset of TDD and ATDD. It uses carefully\nchosen examples to illustrate TDD tools and design patterns, not in\nthe abstract but concretely in the context of the technologies you\nface at work. It is accessible to TDD beginners, and it offers\neffective and less well known techniques to older TDD hands.\nWhat's Inside<br/>\nLearn hands-on to test drive Java code How to avoid common TDD\nadoption pitfalls Acceptance test driven development and the Fit\nframework How to test Java EE components-Servlets, JSPs, and Spring\nControllers Tough issues like multithreaded programs and data\naccess code</p></span>",

Cryptography provides three services that are crucial in secure programming. These include a cryptographic cipher that protects the secrecy of your data; cryptographic certificates, which prove identity (authentication);  and digital signatures, which ensure your data has not been damaged  or tampered with.This book covers cryptographic programming in Java. Java 1.1 and Java 1.2 provide extensive support for cryptography with an elegant architecture, the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA). Another set of classes, the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), provides additional cryptographic functionality. This book covers the JCA and the JCE from top to bottom, describing the use of the cryptographic classes as well as their innards.The book is designed for moderately experienced Java programmers who want to learn how to build cryptography into their applications. No prior knowledge of cryptography is assumed. The book is peppered with useful examples, ranging from simple demonstrations in the first chapter to full-blown applications in later chapters.Topics include:</p><ul><li>The Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA)</li><li>The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)</li><li>Cryptographic providers</li><li>The Sun key management tools</li><li>Message digests, digital signatures, and certificates (X509v3)</li><li>Block and stream ciphers</li><li>Implementations of the ElGamal signature and cipher algorithms</li><li>A network talk application that encrypts all data sent over the network</li><li>An email application that encrypts its messages</li></ul>Covers JDK 1.2 and JCE 1.2.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Many serious Java programmers, especially enterprise Java programmers, consider the new I/O API--called NIO for New Input/Output--the most important feature in the 1.4 version of the Java 2 Standard Edition. The NIO package includes many things that have been missing from previous editions of Java that are critical to writing high-performance, large-scale applications: improvements in the areas of buffer management, scalable network and file I/O, character-set support, and regular expression matching.  Most of all, it boosts performance and speed dramatically.<i>Java NIO</i> explores the new I/O capabilities of version 1.4 in detail and shows you how to put these features to work to greatly improve the efficiency of the Java code you write.  This compact volume examines the typical challenges that Java programmers face with I/O and shows you how to take advantage of the capabilities of the new I/O features.  You?ll learn how to put these tools to work using examples of common, real-world I/O problems and see how the new features have a direct impact on responsiveness, scalability, and reliability.  The book includes:</p><ul><li>A rundown of the new features in NIO</li><li>Basic and advanced I/O Concepts</li><li>Binary I/O and the new buffer classes</li><li>Memory mapped files and file locking</li><li>Character I/O: encoding, decoding and transforming character data</li><li>Regular Expressions and the new java.util.regex package</li><li>Muliplexing with java.nio</li></ul>Because the NIO APIs supplement the I/O features of version 1.3, rather than replace them, you'll also learn when to use new APIs and when the older 1.3 I/O APIs are better suited to your particular application.<i>Java NIO</i> is for any Java programmer who is interested in learning how to boost I/O performance, but if you're developing applications where performance is critical, such as game computing or large-scale enterprise applications, you'll want to give this book a permanent spot on your bookshelf.  With the NIO APIs, Java no longer takes a backseat to any language when it comes to performance.  <i>Java NIO</i> will help you realize the benefits of these exciting new features.</div></span>",

			"title": "Java Distributed Computing",
			"description": "<span><span><div><p>Distributed computing and Java go together naturally. As the first language designed from the bottom up with networking in mind, Java makes it very easy for computers to cooperate. Even the simplest applet running in a browser is a distributed application, if you think about it. The client running the browser downloads and executes code that is delivered by some other system. But even this simple applet wouldn't be possible without Java's guarantees of portability and security: the applet can run on any platform, and can't sabotage its host.Of course, when we think of distributed computing, we usually think of applications more complex than a client and server communicating with the same protocol. We usually think in terms of programs that make remote procedure calls, access remote databases, and collaborate with others to produce a single result. <i>Java Distributed Computing</i> discusses how to design and write such applications. It covers Java's RMI (Remote Method Invocation) facility and CORBA, but it doesn't stop there; it tells you how to design your own protocols to build message passing systems and discusses how to use Java's security facilities, how to write multithreaded servers, and more. It pays special attention to distributed data systems, collaboration, and applications that have high bandwidth requirements.In the future, distributed computing can only become more important.<i>Java Distributed Computing</i> provides a broad introduction to the problems you'll face and the solutions you'll find as you write distributed computing applications.Topics covered in <i>Java Distributed Computing</i>:</p><ul><li>Introduction to Distributed Computing</li><li>Networking Basics</li><li>Distributed Objects (Overview of CORBA and RMI)</li><li>Threads</li><li>Security</li><li>Message Passing Systems</li><li>Distributed Data Systems (Databases)</li><li>Bandwidth Limited Applications</li><li>Collaborative Systems</li></ul></div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><div><p>The author of the best-selling <i>Java in a Nutshell</i> has created an entire book of real-world Java programming examples that you can learn from. If you learn best \"by example,\" this is the book for you.This third edition covers Java 1.4 and contains 193 complete, practical examples: over 21,900 lines of densely commented, professionally written Java code, covering 20 distinct client-side and server-side APIs. It includes new chapters on the Java Sound API and the New I/O API.  The chapters on XML and servlets have been rewritten to cover the latest versions of the specifications and to demonstrate best practices for Java 1.4. New and updated examples throughout the book demonstrate many other new Java features and APIs.<i>Java Examples in a Nutshell</i> is a companion volume to <i>Java in a Nutshell</i>, <i>Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell</i>, and <i>Java Enterprise in a Nutshell</i>. It picks up where those quick references leave off, providing a wealth of examples for both novices and experts.  This book doesn't hold your hand; it simply delivers well-commented working examples with succinct explanations to help you learn and explore Java and its APIs.<i>Java Examples in a Nutshell</i> contains examples that demonstrate:</p><ul><li>Core APIs, including I/O, New I/O, threads, networking, security, serialization, and reflection</li><li>Desktop APIs, highlighting Swing GUIs, Java 2D graphics, preferences, printing, drag-and-drop, JavaBeans, applets, and sound</li><li>Enterprise APIs, including JDBC (database access), JAXP (XML parsing and transformation), Servlets 2.4, JSP 2.0 (JavaServer Pages), and RMI</li></ul>The book begins with introductory examples demonstrating structured and object-oriented programming techniques for new Java programmers.  A special index at the end of the book makes it easy to look up examples that use a particular Java class or accomplish a desired task. In between, each chapter includes exercises that challenge readers and suggest further avenues for exploration.</div></span></span>",

All you need to get started is familiarity with basic Java object-oriented programming concepts.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Use lambda expressions to simplyfy code</li><li>Use function composition to achieve code fluency</li><li>Apply streams to simply implementations and achieve parallelism</li><li>Incorporate recursion to support an application's functionality</li><li>Provide more robust implementations using Optionals</li><li>Implement design patterns with less code</li><li>Refactor object-oriented code to create a functional solution</li><li>Use debugging and testing techniques specific to functional programs</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Functional programming is an increasingly popular technology that allows you to simplify many tasks that are often cumbersome and awkward using an object-oriented approach. It is important to understand this approach and know how and when to apply it. Functional programming requires a different mindset, but once mastered it can be very rewarding.</p><p>This book simplifies the learning process as a problem is described followed by its implementation using an object-oriented approach and then a solution is provided using appropriate functional programming techniques.</p><p>Writing succinct and maintainable code is facilitated by many functional programming techniques including lambda expressions and streams. In this book, you will see numerous examples of how these techniques can be applied starting with an introduction to lambda expressions. Next, you will see how they can replace older approaches and be combined to achieve surprisingly elegant solutions to problems.</p><p>This is followed by the investigation of related concepts such as the Optional class and monads, which offer an additional approach to handle problems. Design patterns have been instrumental in solving common problems. You will learn how these are enhanced with functional techniques.</p><p>To transition from an object-oriented approach to a functional one, it is useful to have IDE support. IDE tools to refactor, debug, and test functional programs are demonstrated through the chapters. The end of the book brings together many of these functional programming techniques to create a more comprehensive application. You will find this book a very useful resource to learn and apply functional programming techniques in Java.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>In this tutorial, each chapter starts with an introduction to the terms and concepts covered in that chapter. It quickly progresses to contrast an object-oriented approach with a functional approach using numerous code examples.</p></span>",

			"title": "Java and SOAP",
			"description": "<span><span><p><i>Java and SOAP</i> provides Java developers with an in-depth look at SOAP (the Simple Object Access Protocol).  Of course, it covers the basics: what SOAP is, why it's soared to a spot on the Buzzwords' Top Ten list, and what its features and capabilities are.  And it shows you how to work with some of the more common Java APIs in the SOAP world: Apache SOAP and GLUE.In addition to covering the basics such as the structure of a SOAP message, SOAP encoding, and building simple services using RPC and messaging, Java and SOAP covers many topics that are essential to real-world development.  Although SOAP has native support for an impressive number of object types, the nature of modern programming means that whatever SOAP gives you is not enough.  When do you need to add support for your own object types, and how do you do it?  How do you handle errors, and how do you add your own information to Fault messages?  How do you handle attachments?In an ideal world, you could live entirely within Java, and ignore the SOAP messages being send back and forth: you'd be able to write Java code and let the SOAP APIs work behind the scenes.  However, we're not yet in that ideal world, and won't be for some time. Therefore, Java and SOAP pays particular attention to how SOAP messages are encoded.  It doesn't just explain the document types, but shows how the documents are used in practice as they are generated by the different APIs.  If you ever have to debug interoperability problems, you'll find that this information is indispensable.We've always found that the best software is written by people who understand what's happening under the hood.  SOAP is no different.  Let's say you need to write a custom serializer to create a SOAP representation of a structure.  How do you know that your encoding is efficient?  There's one definitive answer: look at the SOAP documents it produces!<i>Java and SOAP</i> also discusses interoperability between the major SOAP platforms, including Microsoft's .NET, SOAP messaging, SOAP attachments, message routing, and a preview of the forthcoming AXIS APIs and server.  If you're a Java developer who would like to start working with SOAP, this is the book you need to get going.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Java Performance Tuning, 2nd Edition",
			"description": "<span><div><p>Performance has been an important issue for Java developers ever since the first version hit the streets. Over the years, Java performance has improved dramatically, but tuning is essential to get the best results, especially for J2EE applications. You can never have code that runs too fast.<i>Java Peformance Tuning</i>, 2nd edition provides a comprehensive and indispensable guide to eliminating all types of performance problems. Using many real-life examples to work through the tuning process in detail, JPT shows how tricks such as minimizing object creation and replacing strings with arrays can really pay off in improving your code's performance.Tuning J2EE applications bears many similarities to tuning J2SE apps, but important and specific considerations apply. For this reason, <i>Java Performance Tuning</i>, Second Edition includes four new chapters: a new chapter on J2EE application tuning in general followed by chapters on tuning JDBC, servlets and JSPs, and EJBs.<i>Java Performance Tuning</i> offers common-sense advice about what to tune and what to leave alone, emphasizing techniques that provide big performance gains with minimal code restructuring. It gives you crucial guidance that helps you tune without destroying your program's architecture. Blindly changing things in an effort to make a program run faster is a great way to create buggy, unmaintainable code. <i>Java Performance Tuning</i> teaches you to work efficiently and effectively, resulting in code that is robust, maintainable, and fast.<i>Java Performance Tuning</i>, Second Edition shows you how to:</p><ul><li>Create a performance plan</li><li>Glean information about your program's behavior from profiling tools</li><li>Identify bottlenecks before tuning</li><li>Minimize the number of objects your program creates, particularly critical for J2EE applications</li><li>Optimize the use of strings</li><li>Avoid performance penalties from inefficient code</li><li>Improve the behavior of loops and switches</li><li>Optimize I/O behavior</li><li>Use appropriate algorithms for sorting and other common tasks</li><li>Use threads effectively</li><li>Optimize the performance of distributed systems</li><li>Speed up servlets and JSPs</li><li>Structure JDBC usage efficiently</li><li>Use effective design patterns to optimize EJB performance</li></ul>Covers JDK 1.4</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><div><p><i>AppleScript in a Nutshell</i> is the first complete reference to  AppleScript, the popular programming language that gives both power  users and sophisticated enterprise customers the important ability to  automate repetitive tasks and customize applications. As the Macintosh  continues to expand and solidify its base in the multimedia and  publishing industries, AppleScript is the tool of choice on this  platform for creating sophisticated time- and money-saving workflow  applications (applets). These applets automate the processing and  management of digital video, imaging, print, and web-based material.  AppleScript is also gaining a foothold in scientific programming, as  technical organizations adopt G4 CPU-based systems for advanced  computing and scientific analysis. Finally, \"power users\" and script  novices will find that AppleScript is a great everyday Mac programming  tool, similar to Perl on Windows NT or Unix.In this well-organized and concise reference, AppleScript programmers  will find:</p><ul><li>Detailed coverage of AppleScript Version 1.4 and beyond on Mac OS 9  and Mac OS X.</li><li>Complete descriptions of AppleScript language features, such as data  types, flow-control statements, functions, object-oriented features  (script objects and libraries), and other syntactical elements.</li><li>Descriptions and hundreds of code samples on programming the various  \"scriptable\" system components, such as the Finder, File Sharing, File  Exchange, Network scripting, Web scripting, Apple System Profiler, the  ColorSync program, and the numerous powerful language extensions called  \"osax\" or scripting additions.Most other AppleScript books are hopelessly out of date. <i>AppleScript  in a Nutshell</i> covers the latest updates and improvements with  practical, easy to understand tips, including:</li><li>Using AppleScript as a tool for distributed computing, an exciting  development that Apple Computer calls \"program linking over IP.\"  Programmers can now do distributed computing with Macs over TCP/IP  networks, including controlling remote applications with AppleScript and  calling AppleScript methods on code libraries that are located on other  machines.</li><li>Using the Sherlock find application to automate web and network  searching.</li><li>Insights on scripting new Apple technologies such as Apple Data  Detectors, Folder Actions, Keychain Access, and Apple Verifier.<i>AppleScript in a Nutshell</i> is a high-end handbook at a low-end  price--an essential desktop reference that puts the full power of this  user-friendly programming language into every AppleScript user's hands.</li></ul></div></span></span>",

			"title": "Jython Essentials",
			"description": "<span><p>Jython is an implementation of the Python programming language written in 100% pure Java, so it runs under any compliant Java Virtual Machine. The secret to Jython's popularity lies in the combination of Java's librariesand tools with Python's rapid development capabilities. With Jython, you can write Python programs that integrate seamlessly with any Java code. And like Python, Jython can be used interactively, so you can get immediate results as you are programming.<i>Jython Essentials</i> provides a solid introduction to the Python language, offering a brief but thorough tour of the Python concepts you'll need to understand to use Jython effectively.  The book makes frequent comparisonsbetween Python and Java, with special emphasis on the different object-oriented semantics of the two languages, so Java programmers can quickly get up to speed with Jython.<i>Jython Essentials</i> also covers the various ways in which Jython and Java can interact.  For example, Jython code can create instances of pre-existing Java classes and call methods in those instances.  You can write Jython classes that are direct subclasses of existing Java classesand use introspection to discern the capabilities of JavaBeans components.  This book provides examples of using Jython with existing Java libraries, including the Swing GUI toolkit, the JDBC database API, the Servlet API, and various XML tools.  And finally, the book shows howJython can be used as a scripting language within a Java program.With <i>Jython Essentials</i>, you have everything you need to start creating applications that mix the best of Python's interactivity and Java's robust libraries.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>All of Java's Input/Output (I/O) facilities are based on streams, which provide simple ways to read and write data of different types. Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own application. The universe of streams is divided into four largecategories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automaticallycompressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient? <i>Java I/O</i>, 2nd Edition has been updated for Java 5.0 APIs and tells you all you ever need to know about streams--and probably more. </p><p>A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java supports the Unicode standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting textual and numeric data. <i>Java I/O</i>, 2nd Edition shows you how to control number formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software. </p><p><i>Java I/O</i>, 2nd Edition includes:</p><ul><li>Coverage of all I/O classes and related classes</li><li>In-depth coverage of Java's number formatting facilities and its support for international character sets</li></ul></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>One of Java's most striking claims is that it provides a secure programming environment. Yet despite endless discussion, few people understand precisely what Java's claims mean and how it backs up those claims. If you're a developer, network administrator or anyone else who must understand or work with Java's security mechanisms, Java Security is the in-depth exploration you need.<i>Java Security,</i> 2nd Edition, focuses on the basic platform features of Java that provide security--the class loader, the bytecode verifier, and the security manager--and recent additions to Java that enhance this security model: digital signatures, security providers, and the access controller. The book covers the security model of Java 2, Version 1.3, which is significantly different from that of Java 1.1. It has extensive coverage of the two new important security APIs: JAAS (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) and JSSE (Java Secure Sockets Extension). <i>Java Security,</i> 2nd Edition, will give you a clear understanding of the architecture of Java's security model and how to use that model in both programming and administration.The book is intended primarily for programmers who want to write secure Java applications. However, it is also an excellent resource for system and network administrators who are interested in Java security, particularly those who are interested in assessing the risk of using Java and need to understand how the security model works in order to assess whether or not Java meets their security needs.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nThe Eclipse platform continues to gain tremendous popularity as\nboth a Java IDE and a Java platform for application programming.\nOne of the core underpinnings of Eclipse is SWT, the Standard\nWidget Toolkit. This set of components can be used to develop\ngraphical user interfaces in Java,and offer a native-code\nalternative to Java's Swing and AWT components. Incorporating the\nlook and feel of whatever platform the code is run on, SWT offers a\nlightning-fast approach to building GUIs, all of which actually\n<em>look</em> like they belong on the platform on which they are run.\nBut you already know what you want to do--so wading through the\nbasics of user interface design, graphical components, and what a\nbutton does is simply a waste of time. Enter <em>SWT: A Developer's\nNotebook</em>. In typical <em>Developer's Notebook</em> style, you'll\nlearn how to take SWT out for a spin, make it work for you, and\nturn it upside down, all without wasted words or space. Each lab in\nthis notebook details a specific task; you can read from the first\npage to the last, look up just what you need to know, and even\nsqueeze this book into your laptop bag as a quick reference when\nyou forget how to create a multi-tabbed view. This book covers:\n</p><ul><li><p>Downloading and configuring Eclipse and SWT</p></li><li><p>Menus, toolbars, and buttons</p></li><li><p>Building tabbed layouts and folders</p></li><li><p>SWT's unique coolbar control</p></li><li><p>Adding listeners and responding to events</p></li><li><p>Building a complete SWT-based application</p></li></ul></span></span></span>",

Over the years, its popularity has grown to the point where it plays an important role in most of our lives. From laptops to data centers, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere! There are tons of applications and heaps of websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. And, of course, Java is used to power what has become the world's most dominant mobile platform, Android.</p><p>Advanced Topics In Java teaches the algorithms and concepts that any budding software developer should know. You'll delve into topics such as sorting, searching, merging, recursion, random numbers and simulation, among others. You will increase the range of problems you can solve when you learn how to create and manipulate versatile and popular data structures such as binary trees and hash tables.</p><p>This book assumes you have a working knowledge of basic programming concepts such as variables, constants, assignment, selection (if..else) and looping (while, for). It also assumes you are comfortable with writing functions and working with arrays. If you study this book carefully and do the exercises conscientiously, you would become a better and more agile software developer, more prepared to code today's applications - no matter the language.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>What are and how to use some advanced algorithms, implemented in Java</p></li><li><p>How to create, manipulate and use linked lists, stacks and queues</p></li><li><p>How to use random numbers to program games and simulations</p></li><li><p>How to work with files, binary trees and hash tables</p></li><li><p>Sophisticated sorting methods such as heapsort, quicksort and mergesort</p></li><li><p>How to implement all of the above in Java</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for those with a working knowledge of basic software development topic concepts, such as variables, constants, assignment, selection (if..else) and looping (while, for).

			"description": "<span><span><p>\nThe Swing classes eliminate Java's biggest weakness: its relatively\nprimitive user interface toolkit. Swing provides many new\ncomponents and containers that allow you to build sophisticated\nuser interfaces, far beyond what was possible with AWT. The old\ncomponents have been greatly improved, and there are many new\ncomponents, like trees, tables, and even text editors. It also adds\nseveral completely new features to Java's user interface\ncapabilities: drag-and-drop, undo, and the ability to develop your\nown \"look and feel,\" or the ability to choose between several\nstandard looks. The Swing components are all \"lightweight,\" and\ntherefore provide more uniform behavior across platforms, making it\neasier to test your software. All these new features mean that\nthere's a lot to learn. Swing is undoubtedly way ahead of AWT --\nor, for that matter, any widely available user interface toolkit --\nbut it's also a lot more complicated. It's still easy to do simple\nthings. But once you've seen what's possible, you won't want to do\nthe simple things. <em>Java Swing</em> gives you in-depth coverage of\neverything you need to know to take full advantage of Swing,\nproviding detailed descriptions of every class and interface in the\nkey Swing packages. It shows you how to use all of the new\ncomponents, allowing you to build state-of-the-art user interfaces.\nIt also discusses how the components implement the MVC (Model View\nController) architecture, so you can understand how the components\nare designed and subclass them intelligently. Finally, it shows how\nto create your own \"look and feel.\" Throughout, <em>Java Swing</em>\nfocuses on giving you the context you need to understand what\nyou're doing. It's more than documentation; <em>Java Swing</em> helps\nyou develop code quickly and effectively. Whether you're a serious\nJava developer, or just trying to find out what Java can do, you'll\nfind <em>Java Swing</em> an indispensable guide.\n</p></span></span>",

The ability to see the potential for a strong picture and then organize the graphic elements into an effective, compelling composition has always been one of the key skills in making photographs. </p><p>Digital photography has brought a new, exciting aspect to design - first because the instant feedback from a digital camera allows immediate appraisal and improvement; and second because image-editing tools make it possible to alter and enhance the design after the shutter has been pressed. This has had a profound effect on the way digital photographers take pictures. </p><p>Now published in sixteen languages, The Photographer's Eye continues to speak to photographers everywhere. Reaching 100,000 copies in print in the US alone, and 300,000+ worldwide, it shows how anyone can develop the ability to see and shoot great digital photographs. The book explores all the traditional approaches to composition and design, but crucially, it also addresses the new digital technique of shooting in the knowledge that a picture will later be edited, manipulated, or montaged to result in a final image that may be very different from the one seen in the viewfinder.</p></span>",

The first part deals with techniques for programming in shared-memory based systems. The book covers concepts in Java such as threads, synchronized methods, waits, and notify to expose students to basic concepts for multi-threaded programming. It also includes algorithms for mutual exclusion, consensus, atomic objects, and wait-free data structures.<br/> The second part of the book deals with programming in a message-passing system. This part covers resource allocation problems, logical clocks, global property detection, leader election, message ordering, agreement algorithms, checkpointing, and message logging. Primarily a textbook for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students, this thorough treatment will also be of interest to professional programmers.\n   \n  </span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nFor many Java developers, web services appeared to come out of\nnowhere. Its advantages are clear: web services are\nplatform-independent (like Java itself), language-agnostic (a clear\nadvantage over Java RMI), can easily be tunneled through firewalls\n(an obvious benefit to anyone who has dealt with modern enterprise\nnetworks), object-oriented (we all know about that), and tends to\nbe loosely coupled (allowing more flexible application\ndevelopment). But these advantages have been obscured by a cloud of\nhype and a proliferation of jargon that are difficult to penetrate.\nWhat are SOAP, UDDI, WSDL, and JAXM? To say nothing of JAXR,\ntModels, category bags, WSFL, and other friends? And assuming that\nyou understand what they are, how do you do anything with them? Do\nthey live up to their promises? Are they really the future of\nnetwork computing, or a dead end? <em>Java Web Services</em> gives\nthe experienced Java developer a way into the Web Services world.\nIt helps you to understand what's going on, what the technologies\nmean and how they relate, and shows Java developers how to put them\nto use to solve real problems. You'll learn what's real and what\nisn't; what the technologies are really supposed to do, and how\nthey do it. Java Web Services shows you how to use SOAP to perform\nremote method calls and message passing; how to use WSDL to\ndescribe the interface to a web service or understand the interface\nof someone else's service; and how to use UDDI to advertise\n(publish) and look up services in each local or global registry.\nJava Web Services also discusses security issues, interoperability\nissues, integration with other Java enterprise technologies like\nEJB; the work being done on the JAXM and JAX-RPC packages, and\nintegration with Microsoft's .NET services. The web services\npicture is still taking shape; there are many platforms and APIs to\nconsider, and many conflicting claims from different marketing\ngroups. And although web services are inherently\nlanguage-independent, the fit between the fundamental principles on\nwhich Java and web services are based means that Java will almost\ncertainly be the predominant language for web services development.\nIf you're a Java developer and want to climb on the web services\nbandwagon, or if you only want to \"kick the tires\" and find out\nwhat web services has to offer, you will find this book\nindispensable.\n</p></span></span></span>",

It will help you avoid common\npitfalls that doom many such projects and will show you a clear\npath to success. The techniques are derived from the experience of\nmany individuals and organizations. Many are also fun to apply.\nThis stuff is really cool—and really hot.”<br/>\n<b>—Joseph Bergin,</b> professor of computer science, Pace\nUniversity, New York</p><p>“If change is the only guarantee in life, why is it so\nhard to do? As this book points out, people are not so much\nresistant to change itself as they are to being changed. Mary Lynn\nand Linda have successfully used the pattern form to capture and\npresent the recurring lessons of successful change efforts and have\nplaced a powerful knowledge resource in the hands of their\nreaders.”<br/>\n<b>—Alan O'Callaghan,</b> researcher, Software Technology\nResearch Laboratory, De Montfort University, United Kingdom</p><p>“The most difficult part of absorbing patterns, or any\ntechnology, into an organization is overcoming the people issues.\nThe patterns in this book are the documentation of having gone\nthrough that experience, giving those that dare push the envelope a\nhead start at success.”<b>—David E.

			"description": "<span><p>Java developers typically go through four \"stages\" in mastering Java.  In the first stage, they learn the language itself. In the second stage, they study the APIs. In the third stage, they become proficient in the environment. It is in the fourth stage --\"the expert stage\"-- where things really get interesting, and <i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i> is the tangible compendium of experience that developers need to breeze through this fourth and final stage of Enterprise Java mastery.Crammed with tips and tricks, <i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i> distills years of solid experience from eleven experts in the J2EE environment into a practical, to-the-point guide to J2EE.<i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i> gives developers the unvarnished, expert-tested advice that the man pages don't provide--what areas of the APIs should be used frequently (and which are better avoided); elegant solutions to problems you face that other developers have already discovered; what things you should always do, what things you should consider doing, and what things you should never do--even if the documentation says it's ok.Until <i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i>, Java developers in the fourth stage of mastery relied on the advice of a loose-knit community of fellow developers, time-consuming online searches for examples or suggestions for the immediate problem they faced, and tedious trial-and-error. But Java has grown to include a huge number of APIs, classes, and methods. Now it is simply too large for even the most intrepid developer to know it all.  The need for a written compendium of J2EE Best Practices has never been greater.<i>Java Enterprise Best Practices</i> focuses on the Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) APIs. The J2EE APIs include such alphabet soup acronyms as EJB, JDBC, RMI, XML, and JMX.</p></span>",

			"title": "Handbook of Constraint Programming",
			"description": "<span>Constraint programming is a powerful paradigm for solving combinatorial search problems that draws on a wide range of techniques from artificial intelligence, computer science, databases, programming languages, and operations research.  Constraint programming is currently applied with success to many domains, such as scheduling, planning, vehicle routing, configuration, networks, and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>The aim of this handbook is to capture the full breadth and depth of the constraint programming field and to be encyclopedic in its scope and coverage. While there are several excellent books on constraint programming, such books necessarily focus on the main notions and techniques and cannot cover also extensions, applications, and languages. The handbook gives a reasonably complete coverage of all these lines of work, based on constraint programming, so that a reader can have a rather precise idea of the whole field and its potential. Of course each line of work is dealt with in a survey-like style, where some details may be neglected in favor of coverage. However, the extensive bibliography of each chapter will help the interested readers to find suitable sources for the missing details. Each chapter of the handbook is intended to be a self-contained survey of a topic, and is written by one or more authors who are leading researchers in the area.<br/><br/>The intended audience of the handbook is researchers, graduate students, higher-year undergraduates and practitioners who wish to learn about the state-of-the-art in constraint programming. No prior knowledge about the field is necessary to be able to read the chapters and gather useful knowledge. Researchers from other fields should find in this handbook an effective way to learn about constraint programming and to possibly use some of the constraint programming concepts and techniques in their work, thus providing a means for a fruitful cross-fertilization among different research areas.<br/><br/>The handbook is organized in two parts. The first part covers the basic foundations of constraint programming, including the history, the notion of constraint propagation, basic search methods, global constraints, tractability and computational complexity, and important issues in modeling a problem as a constraint problem. The second part covers constraint languages and solver, several useful extensions to the basic framework (such as interval constraints, structured domains, and distributed CSPs), and successful application areas for constraint programming.<br/><br/>- Covers the whole field of constraint programming<br/>- Survey-style chapters<br/>- Five chapters on applications</span>",

As soon as you pick up this book, Vishal Layka's experience guides you on a very practical learning and building journey.</p><p>You will learn the Java nuts and bolts necessary to build a simple \"HelloWorld\" Java (native) application, as well as a \"HelloWorld\" Java-based web application example that utilizes servlets and Java Server Pages (JSPs). Over the course of the book, you'll learn more about servlets and JSPs and delve into Java Server Faces (JSFs) and the expression language found in each of these by applying them in a real-world case study—a book store e-commerce application. Then you'll build your web application using Apache Struts2 and the Spring MVC framework.</p><p>The book concludes by exploring the web application that you've built and examining industry best practices and how these might fit with your application, as well as covering alternative Java Web frameworks like Groovy/Grails and Scala/Play 2. You also can explore the basics of Java, Groovy, and Scala in the book's appendices.</p><p>While reading this book, you'll see all this in action and you can use it as a starting point for further Java web development.

			"description": "<span><p>Version 5.0 of the Java 2 Standard Edition SDK is the most important upgrade since Java first appeared a decade ago. With Java 5.0, you'll not only find substantial changes in the platform, but to the language itself-something that developers of Java took five years to complete. The main goal of Java 5.0 is to make it easier for you to develop safe, powerful code, but none of these improvements makes Java any easier to learn, even if you've programmed with Java for years. And that means our bestselling hands-on tutorial takes on even greater significance.<br/><br/><i>Learning Java</i> is the most widely sought introduction to the programming language that's changed the way we think about computing. Our updated third edition takes an objective, no-nonsense approach to the new features in Java 5.0, some of which are drastically different from the way things were done in any previous versions. The most essential change is the addition of \"generics\", a feature that allows developers to write, test, and deploy code once, and then reuse the code again and again for different data types. The beauty of generics is that more problems will be caught during development, and <i>Learning Java</i> will show you exactly how it's done.<br/><br/>Java 5.0 also adds more than 1,000 new classes to the Java library. That means 1,000 new things you can do without having to program it in yourself. That's a huge change.

			"description": "<span><span><p><em>Enterprise JavaBeans</em> was recently voted \"Best Java Book\" by\nthe editors and readers of Java Developer's Journal. Readers of\nJavaPro named it the \"Best Java Book for Experts.\" And Amazon.com\nincluded it in the Top Computer Books for 2000. Now the best only\ngets better! In the new 3rd edition, <em>Enterprise JavaBeans</em>\nhas been completely revised and updated with a thorough\nintroduction to the new 2.0 version of the EJB specification.\nSignificantly different from the earlier version, the 2.0\nspecification introduces three dramatic improvements: A completely\nnew version of container-managed persistence; local interfaces; and\na totally new kind of bean called the \"message driven bean.\" The\nnew version of container-managed persistence (CMP) beans in 2.0 is\nmore portable and robust than in the older 1.1 version. Most\nsignificant is the introduction of the relationship fields, which\nallow entity beans to declare relationships with each other as\nnatural references. In order to make this huge leap in component\nrelationships possible, EJB 2.0 had to redesign how entity beans\nare defined and interact. Our new 3rd edition examines this\ncritical CMP model in detail. Local interfaces are thoroughly\ndiscussed as well. Local interfaces allow beans that are co-located\nto interact without the overhead of remote method calls. This\nimproves the performance of beans considerably and complements the\nCMP relationship fields. Message driven beans are a new kind of\nenterprise bean based on asynchronous messaging and the Java\nMessage service (JMS). Instead of responding to Java RMI calls,\nmessage driven beans process JMS messages sent by messaging\nclients. An entire chapter is devoted to message-driven beans and\nhow to use them effectively. In addition, the 3rd edition contains\nan architecture overview, information on resource management and\nprimary services, design strategies, and XML deployment\ndescriptors.\n</p></span></span>",

Since Java Enterprise in a Nutshell was\nfirst published in September of 1999, a dozen or more new APIs have\nbeen added to the platform, reflecting the new and different ways\ndevelopers implement their enterprise objectives. And now\ndevelopers are being called on to add even greater, more complex\nlevels of interconnectivity to their applications, as the concepts\nbehind Web Services solidify and implementation decisions need\ncoding. Java developers today need a clear understanding of the new\nAPIs, tools, capabilities and pitfalls in J2EE 2.0 so they can plan\na technology and implementation strategy for new enterprise\nprojects. Fortunately, this is exactly what they get with the new\n<em>Java Enterprise in a Nutshell, 2nd edition</em>! Completely\nrevised and updated for the new 2.0 version of Sun Microsystems\nJava Enterprise Edition software, Java Enterprise in a Nutshell 2nd\nedition covers all of the J2EE APIs, including RMI, Java IDL, JDBC,\nJNDI, Java Servlet, and Enterprise JavaBeans, with a fast-paced\ntutorial and compact reference on each technology. Then Java\nEnterprise in a Nutshell goes even further, providing a classic\nO'Reilly-style quick reference for all of the classes in the\nvarious packages that comprise the Enterprise APIs - covering the\ncore enterprise APIs as well as numerous standard extensions.\n</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><div><p>Java programmers know how finicky Java can be to work with. An omitted semi-colon or the slightest typo will cause the Java command-line compiler to spew pages of annoying error messages across your screen.  And it doesn't fix them--that's up to you: fix them, compile again, and hope that nothing goes wrong this time.Eclipse, the popular Java integrated development environment (IDE) provides an elegant and powerful remedy for this common, frustrating scenario.  It doesn't just catch your errors before you compile, it also suggests solutions. All you need to do is point and click. And it's free--what could be better? Still, if you're like most programmers, mastering a new technology--no matter how productive it will make you in the long run--is going to take a chunk out of your productivity now. You want to get up to speed quickly without sacrificing efficiency.O'Reilly's new guide to the technology, <i>Eclipse</i>, provides exactly what you're looking for: a fast-track approach to mastery of Eclipse.  This insightful, hands-on book delivers clear and concise coverage, with no fluff, that gets down to business immediately. The book is tightly focused, covering all aspects of Eclipse: the menus, preferences, views, perspectives, editors, team and debugging techniques, and how they're used every day by thousands of developers.  Development of practical skills is emphasized with dozens of examples presented throughout the book.From cover-to-cover, the book is pure Eclipse, covering hundreds of techniques beginning with the most basic Java development through creating your own plug-in editors for the Eclipse environment. Some of the topics you'll learn about include:</p><ul><li>Using Eclipse to develop Java code</li><li>Testing and debugging</li><li>Working in teams using CVS</li><li>Building Eclipse projects using Ant</li><li>The Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT)</li><li>Web development</li><li>Developing Struts applications with Eclipse</li></ul>From basics to advanced topics, <i>Eclipse</i> takes you through the fundamentals of Eclipse and more. You may be an Eclipse novice when you pick up the book, but you'll be a pro by the time you've finished.</div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nMore Java developers today want to work with XML, the technology\nthat enables data to be transported intact over the Internet, but\nthey don't have time to become XML experts. If this describes you,\nthen you'll appreciate data binding, the new way of converting XML\ndocuments into Java objects, so those documents can be worked on\nand manipulated like any other Java object, then converted back to\nXML\n</p><p>This new title provides an in-depth technical look at XML Data\nBinding. The book offers complete documentation of all features in\nboth the Sun Microsystems JAXB API and popular open source\nalternative implementations (Enhydra Zeus, Exolabs Castor and\nQuick). It also gets into significant detail about when data\nbinding is appropriate to use, and provides numerous practical\nexamples of using data binding in applications.</p><p>As Author Brett McLaughlin says \"Too many books are written\nabout technologies by people who barely understand them. I've\nalready written two data binding implementations (Zeus, and a\nprevious one for IBM DeveloperWorks.) I've actually used data\nbinding for longer than the official specification has been in\nexistence, and I've really been able to dig into what it takes to\ncode an effective data biding implementation, as well as use one\ncorrectly. This book is part user guide, part under-the-hood\nmanual, and part use-case. It's a powerful combination, and one I\nthink people need.\"</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>The <em>Java AWT Reference</em> provides complete reference documentation on the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), a large collection of classes for building graphical user interfaces in Java. With AWT, you can create windows, draw, work with images, and use components like buttons, scrollbars, and pulldown menus. The <em>Java AWT Reference</em> covers the classes that comprise the java.awt, java.awt.image, java.applet,java.awt.event, and java.awt.datatransfer packages. These classes provide the functionality that allows a Java application to provide user interaction in a graphical environment.This book takes you beyond what you'd expect from a standard reference manual. Classes and methods are, of course, described in detail. But the book does much more. It offers a comprehensive explanation of how AWT components fit together. In working with components, for example, you'll see how events fit into the overall picture, what they mean, and how to use them. The book includes lots of sample code, so that you can learn by example. In addition to descriptions of the standard layout managers, for instance, you'll find an extended code example for writing your own layout manager.The <em>Java AWT Reference</em> is part of O'Reilly's Java documentation series. This edition describes both Version 1.0.2 and Version 1.1 of the Java Development Kit and includes:</p><li><p>Easy-to-use reference material on every AWT class</p></li><li><p>Extended examples that demonstrate important AWT functionality</p></li><li><p>A detailed explanation of Java's image processing mechanisms</p></li><li><p>Coverage of every AWT component and container, showing how to use them in various combinations to create effective interfaces</p></li><li><p>Descriptions of all the layout managers, including GridBagLayout</p></li><p>The <em>Java AWT Reference</em> is meant to be used in conjunction with the Java Fundamental Classes Reference. Together, these two reference manuals cover all of the classes in the the Java Core API. The Java Language Reference completes the package, providing a complete reference on the Java programming language. These manuals comprise the definitive set of Java documentation that you need to do serious programming with Java.O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates also publishes an introductory text,Exploring Java, if you need to get up to speed with this exciting new technology. For advanced Java programming topics, look for upcoming books from O'Reilly on network programming, distributed computing, and database programming. And as new Java APIs become available, O'Reilly is committed to expanding the Java series to cover those as well.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Soon after its launch, Ant succeeded in taking the Java world by storm, becoming the most widely used tool for building applications in Java environments. Like most popular technologies, Ant quickly went through a series of early revision cycles.  With each new version, more functionality was added, and more complexity was introduced. Ant evolved from a simple-to-learn build tool into a full-fledged testing and deployment environment.<i>Ant: The Definitive Guide</i> has been reworked, revised and expanded upon to reflect this evolution.  It documents the new ways that Ant is being applied, as well as the array of optional tasks that Ant supports.  In fact, this new second edition covers everything about this extraordinary  build management  tool from downloading and installing, to using Ant to test code.  Here are just of a few of the features you'll find detailed in this comprehensive, must-have guide:</p><ul><li>Developing conditional builds, and handling error conditions</li><li>Automatically retrieving source code from version control systems</li><li>Using Ant with XML files</li><li>Using Ant with JavaServer Pages to build Web applications</li><li>Using Ant with Enterprise JavaBeans to build enterprise applications</li></ul>Far exceeding its predecessor in terms of information and detail, <i>Ant: The Definitive Guide</i>, 2nd Edition is a must-have for Java developers unfamiliar with the latest advancements in Ant technology.  With this book at your side, you'll soon be up to speed on the premiere tool for cross-platform development.Author Steve Holzner is an award-winning author who s been writing about Java topics since the language first appeared; his books have sold more than 1.5 million copies worldwide.</div></span>",

SQLJ takes you further, allowing you to\naccess a database using embedded SQL statements. <em>Java\nProgramming with Oracle SQLJ</em> shows you how to get the most out\nof SQLJ. Layered on top of JDBC, SQLJ greatly simplifies database\nprogramming. Rather than make several calls to the JDBC API just to\nexecute a simple SQL statement, SQLJ executes that statement simply\nby embedding it within the Java code. In this book, Jason Price\nexplains SQLJ programming from a task-oriented point of view.\nYou'll learn how to:\n</p><ul><li><p>Embed queries and other SQL statements within Java\nprograms</p></li><li><p>Deploy SQLJ code not only on client machines, but\nalso to JServer--Oracle's Java engine built into the database</p></li><li><p>Use advanced techniques for working with\ncollections, streams, large objects, and database objects, all\nwithout leaving the comfort of the SQLJ environment</p></li><li><p>Tune SQLJ programs for maximum performance</p></li></ul><p>\nThroughout the book, the exposition of SQLJ and SQLJ programming\ntechniques reflects the author's many years of professional\nexperience as a programmer and consultant. Examples are first-rate,\nenabling you to learn SQLJ in no time. If you're writing Java code\nto access an Oracle database, you can't afford not to know about\nSQLJ.\n</p></span></span>",

In addition to being platform independent,\nAnt is also independent of the integrated development environment\n(IDE) being used. IDE independence is important for open source\nprojects (or other projects) in which the various developers might\nuse different IDEs. Using Ant, Java developers can:\n</p><li><p>Define build chunks, the results that they must\nproduce, and the dependencies between them</p></li><li><p>Automatically retrieve source code from source\ncontrol systems such as PVCS</p></li><li><p>Build applications by having Ant compile the\nnecessary source files in the proper order</p></li><p>\nAnt build files are written using XML-a well-established\nstandard-so programmers using Ant are not required to learn yet\nanother scripting language. They will likely already know XML, and\nwill be able to leverage that knowledge. Ant is an open source\nproject, and part of the Jakarta project.

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nWhat are the key decisions and tradeoffs you face as you design and\ndevelop enterprise applications? How do you build the back end so\nthat it not only handles your current needs but is flexible enough\nto allow your system to evolve as your needs expand? Answer these\nquestions and many more with <em>Building Java Enterprise\nApplications</em>, an advanced guide to building complex Java\nEnterprise Applications from the ground up that addresses design\nissues along the way. These practical books take a step back from\ndetailed examination of the APIs and focus on the entire picture,\nso you can put the pieces together and build something that works!\nThis book explores the infrastructure issues so important to good\napplication design. It isn't just a book about doing things with\nEntity Beans, JDBC and JMS and JNDI. It takes you step by step\nthrough building the back end, designing the data store so that it\ngives you convenient access to the data your application needs;\ndesigning a directory; figuring out how to handle security and\nwhere to store security credentials you need; and so on. On top of\nthis, it shows -- as easily as possible --how to build the entity\nbean layer that makes information available to the rest of the\napplication. Throughout this guide, author Brett McLaughlin uses\nhis wealth of real-world experience with enterprise development to\nshow you one step at a time how to design and build a comprehensive\nenterprise application from the ground up, starting with the back\nend.\n</p></span></span></span>",

However, despite lots of discussion, few people\nunderstand precisely what Java's claims mean and how it backs up\nthose claims. <em>Java Security</em> is an in-depth exploration aimed\nat developers, network administrators, and anyone who needs to work\nwith or understand Java's security mechanisms. It discusses in\ndetail what security does and doesn't mean, what Java's default\nsecurity policies are, and how to create and implement your own\npolicies. In doing so, <em>Java Security</em> provides detailed\ncoverage of security managers, class loaders, the access\ncontroller, and much of the java.security package. It discusses\nmessage digests, certificates, and digital signatures, showing you\nhow to use Java's facilities for signing classes or to implement\nyour own signature facility. It shows you how to write a class\nloader that recognizes signed classes, verifies the signature, and\ncooperates with a security manager to grant additional privileges.\nIt also discusses the problem of managing cryptographic keys and\nshows you how to implement your own key management systems. <em>Java\nSecurity</em> is an essential book for everyone using Java in\nreal-world software. If you're deploying software written in Java,\nyou need to know how to grant your classes the privileges they\nneed, without granting privileges to untrusted classes. You need to\nknow how to protect your systems against intrusion and corruption.\nJava provides the tools; this book shows you how to use them.\n</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Developing Java Beans",
			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nJava Beans is the most important new development in Java this year.\nBeans is the next generation of Java technology that not only adds\nfeatures the language lacked, but also lets Java programs\ninteroperate with a number of development environments. The initial\nrelease includes a bridge for Microsoft's ActiveX/COM; future\nreleases will include bridges for Netscape's LiveConnect and IBM's\nOpenDoc. Since it's a \"component architecture\" for Java, Beans can\nbe used in graphical programming environments, like Borland's\nJBuilder, or IBM's VisualAge for Java. This means that someone can\nuse a graphical tool to connect a lot of Beans together and make an\napplication, without actually writing any Java code -- in fact,\nwithout doing any programming at all. Graphical development\nenvironments let you configure components by specifying aspects of\ntheir visual appearance (like the color or label of a button) in\naddition to the interactions between components (what happens when\nyou click on a button or select a menu item). One important aspect\nof Java Beans is that components don't have to be visible. This\nsounds like a minor distinction, but it's very important: the\ninvisible parts of an application are the parts that do the work.\nSo, for example, in addition to manipulating graphical widgets,\nlike checkboxes and menus, Beans allows you to develop and\nmanipulate components that do database access, perform\ncomputations, and so on. You can build entire applications by\nconnecting pre-built components, without writing any code.\n<em>Developing Java Beans</em> is for people who need to stay\nup-to-date with the latest developments in programming technology.\nMinimally, developing Beans means adopting several simple design\npatterns in your code. However, that's only the beginning. To take\nfull advantage of the Java Beans architecture, you should\nunderstand how to write classes that are serializable, use events\nfor communication between classes, know when and how to provide\nBeanInfo classes that give graphical environments more information\nabout your components, and provide property editors and customizers\nthat let graphical tools work with more complex Beans. The book\ncovers:\n</p><ul><li><p>Events, event listeners, and adapters</p></li><li><p>Properties, indexed properties, bound properties, constrained\nproperties, and vetoable property changes</p></li><li><p>Persistence, serialization, versioning, and object\nvalidation</p></li><li><p>Packaging Beans using JAR files</p></li><li><p>The BeanBox, a prototypical development tool</p></li><li><p>Reflection and introspection</p></li><li><p>Property editors and customizers</p></li><li><p>The ActiveX bridge; using Java Beans in Visual Basic\nprograms</p></li></ul></span></span></span>",

Bruce believes Java is abandoning its base, and conditions are ripe for an alternative to emerge.</p><p>In <i>Beyond Java</i>, Bruce chronicles the rise of the most successful language of all time, and then lays out, in painstaking detail, the compromises the founders had to make to establish success.  Then, he describes the characteristics of likely successors to Java.  He builds to a rapid and heady climax, presenting alternative languages and frameworks with productivity and innovation unmatched in Java. He closes with an evaluation of the most popular and important programming languages, and their future role in a world beyond Java.</p><p>If you are agree with the book's premise--that Java's reign is coming to an end--then this book will help you start to build your skills accordingly. You can download some of the frameworks discussed and learn a few new languages.  This book will teach you what a new language needs to succeed, so when things do change, you'll be more prepared.  And even if you think Java is here to stay, you can use the best techniques from frameworks introduced in this book to improve what you're doing in Java today.</p></div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nOne weakness of Java has been its graphics capabilities. Java 1.0\nand 1.1 only included simple primitives for line drawing: lines\ncould only be one pixel wide, they could only be solid, and there\nwasn't any good way to draw curves. Font management and color\nmanagement were also weak. Java 2D (collectively called the \"2D\nAPI\") signals a major improvement in Java's graphics capabilities.\nIt covers many of the classes in Java 1.2 that address graphics\nhandling and improves on many weaknesses that were present in the\nprevious versions of Java. The 2D API allows you to produce\nhigh-quality, professional images on a screen or printer. <em>Java\n2D Graphics</em> describes the 2D API from top to bottom,\ndemonstrating how to set line styles and pattern fills as well as\nmore advanced techniques of image processing and font handling.\nYou'll see how to create and manipulate the three types of graphics\nobjects: shapes, text, and images. Other topics include image data\nstorage, color management, font glyphs, and printing. <em>Java 2D\nGraphics</em> assumes no prior knowledge of graphics. Chock full of\ndetailed explanations and examples, this book provides beginning\nJava programmers with a solid foundation in 2D graphics and helps\nmore advanced programmers create and use high-quality images in\ntheir applications. Topics covered in the book include:\n</p><ul><li><p>The rendering pipeline</p></li><li><p>Shapes and paths</p></li><li><p>Geometry</p></li><li><p>Painting with solid colors, gradients, and textures</p></li><li><p>Stroking paths, including dashed lines</p></li><li><p>Transformations: translation, rotation, shearing, and\nscaling</p></li><li><p>Alpha compositing</p></li><li><p>Clipping</p></li><li><p>Rasterizing and antialiasing</p></li><li><p>Fonts and text</p></li><li><p>Font metrics</p></li><li><p>Glyphs</p></li><li><p>Colors and color spaces</p></li><li><p>sRGB and CIEXYZ</p></li><li><p>ICC color profiles</p></li><li><p>Images, image color models, and image data</p></li><li><p>Image processing</p></li><li><p>Image data storage</p></li><li><p>Graphics devices</p></li><li><p>Printing</p></li></ul></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p><em>Java Web Services in a Nutshell</em> is a high-speed tutorial and\na quick reference for the technologies that Sun Microsystems is\ncreating for implementing web services with Java. This book is a\nsuccinct introduction and handy reference to the Java/XML APIs,\nmore commonly known as the JWSDP or \"Java Web Services Development\nPack.\" These APIs are taking the Java world by storm, as they are\ncapable of handling everything from simple XML to SOAP to full\nebXML vocabularies. Although \"web services\" technology has suffered\nfrom much hype and overly grand expectations, there is plenty of\nsolid development going on, especially in extending enterprise\napplications, and a huge amount of this development is being done\nin Java. As a result, the J2EE APIs for web services are evolving\nrapidly, and this new \"in a Nutshell\" book covers them all in\ndepth. One of the most important APIs in the JWSDP is JAX-RPC (Java\nAPI for XML-based RPC). It's also the API that developers most\nconsistently post questions about. <em>Java Web Services in a\nNutshell</em> covers all aspects of JAX-RPC in detail, with tutorial\ncoverage alone exceeding 150 pages. This book offers developers\neverything they need to program with JAX-RPC. <em>Java Web Services\nin a Nutshell</em> begins with an introduction to Java web services,\nincluding a discussion of how they differ from web applications.\nThe author looks at the protocols and interfaces that underpin web\nservices, the J2EE technologies that address web services, WSDL as\nthe means for describe web services, and more. Subsequent chapters\ncover:\n</p><ul><li><p>JAX-RPC</p></li><li><p>SOAP and the SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ)</p></li><li><p>Reliable SOAP messaging with JAXM</p></li><li><p>WSDL</p></li><li><p>Advanced JAX-RPC</p></li><li><p>JAXR, the XML-based registry API</p></li><li><p>Web Services Tools</p></li></ul><p>\nThe balance of the book is made up of an API Quick Reference\ncontaining documentation for the various API packages. Intended for\nJava developers who need to implement Java services or who need\ntheir applications to access existing web services, <em>Java Web\nServices in a Nutshell</em> delivers practical information to help\ndevelopers make sense of the rapidly changing and poorly organized\nofficial documentation. If web services and Enterprise Java are any\npart of your job description -- of if you'd like them to be --\nyou'll want this book close beside as you work.\n</p></span></span></span>",

This comprehensive guide introduces each of the dominant APIs (Enterprise JavaBeans, Java Data Objects, the Java Database Connectivity API (JDBC) as well as other, lesser-known options), explores the methodology and design components that use those APIs, and then offers practices most appropriate for different types and makes of databases, as well as different types of applications.<i>Java Database Practices</i> also examines database design, from table and database architecture to normalization, and offers a number of best practices for handling these tasks as well. Learn how to move through the various forms of normalization, understand when to denormalize, and even get detailed instructions on optimizing your SQL queries to make the best use of your database structure. Through it all, this book focuses on practical application of these techniques, giving you information that can immediately be applied to your own enterprise projects.Enterprise applications in today's world are about data-- whether it be information about a product to buy, a user's credit card information, or the color that a customer prefers for their auto purchases. And just as data has grown in importance, the task of accessing that data has grown in complexity. Until now, you have been left on your own to determine which model best suits your application, and how best to use your chosen API. <i>Java Database Practices</i> is the one stop reference book to help you determine what's appropriate for your specific project at hand. Whether it's choosing between an alphabet soup of APIs and technologies--EJB, JDO, JDBC, SQL, RDBMS, OODBMS, and more on the horizon, this book is an indispensable resource you can't do without.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Java Servlet Programming",
			"description": "<span><span><p>\nA few years ago, the hype surrounding applets put Java on the map\nas a programming language for the Web. Today, Java servlets stand\npoised to take Java to the next level as a Web development\nlanguage. The main reason is that servlets offer a fast, powerful,\nportable replacement for CGI scripts. The Java Servlet API,\nintroduced as the first standard extension to Java, provides a\ngeneric mechanism to extend the functionality of any kind of\nserver. Servlets are most commonly used, however, to extend Web\nservers, performing tasks traditionally handled by CGI programs.\nWeb servers that can support servlets include: Apache, Netscape's\nFastTrack and Enterprise Servers, Microsoft's IIS, O'Reilly's\nWebSite, and JavaSoft's Java Web Server. The beauty of servlets is\nthat they execute within the Web server's process space and they\npersist between invocations. This gives servlets tremendous\nperformance benefits over CGI programs. Yet because they're written\nin Java, servlets are far less likely to crash a Web server than a\nC-based NSAPI or ISAPI extension. Servlets have full access to the\nvarious Java APIs and to third-party component classes, making them\nideal for use in communicating with applets, databases, and RMI\nservers. Plus, servlets are portable between operating systems and\nbetween servers -- with servlets you can \"write once, serve\neverywhere.\" <em>Java Servlet Programming</em> covers everything you\nneed to know to write effective servlets and includes numerous\nexamples that you can use as the basis for your own servlets. The\nbook explains the servlet life cycle, showing how you can use\nservlets to maintain state information effortlessly. It also\ndescribes how to serve dynamic Web content, including both HTML\npages and multimedia data. Finally, it explores more advanced\ntopics like integrated session tracking, efficient database\nconnectivity using JDBC, applet-servlet communication,\ninter-servlet communication, and internationalization.\n</p></span></span>",

I've\nscrolled through endless logfiles to decipher system problems, when\na management solution could have presented an operator with a\nwarning message hours earlier!\" Wanting other developers to be able\nto learn from his experiences, Steve wrote <em>Java Management\nExtensions.</em><em>Java Management Extensions</em> is a practical,\nhands-on guide to using the JMX APIs, Sun Microsystem's new\nJava-based tool for managing enterprise applications. This one-of-a\nkind book is a complete treatment of the JMX architecture (both the\ninstrumentation level and the agent level), and it's loaded with\nreal-world examples for implementing Management Extensions. It also\ncontains useful information at the higher level about JMX (the \"big\npicture\") to help technical managers and architects who are\nevaluating various application management approaches and are\nconsidering JMX. The JMX technology is very new, and according to\nSteve, still has a few \"potholes\" in it. This book takes developers\nthrough it step by step, pointing out the \"gotchas\" before they\nhave a chance to trip up smooth operation of the application. The\nauthor, a member of the expert group developing the JMX\nspecification, points out that as J2EE becomes more widely adopted,\nthe Java standard for management (JMX) becomes more and more\ncrucial to avoid \"splinter standards\" where each vendor has their\nown distinct, arguably successful, way of doing things. \"In my own\ncompany we have already identified and are tackling the problem of\nmanaging our Java applications. It's my belief that other companies\nwill follow, as they come to realize the power that a standard\nmanageability solution (ie, JMX) gives them.\" The book is divided\ninto the following sections:\n</p><ul><li><p>Part I:</p></li><li><p>Introduction and overview</p></li><li><p>Part II:</p></li><li><p>the JMX Instrumentation Level</p></li><li><p>Standard MBeans</p></li><li><p>Dynamic MBeans</p></li><li><p>Model Mbeans</p></li><li><p>Part III:</p></li><li><p>The JMX Agent Level</p></li><li><p>The Mbean Server</p></li><li><p>The JMX Notification Model</p></li><li><p>Dynamic Loading</p></li><li><p>Monitors</p></li><li><p>Timer Services</p></li><li><p>Relation Services</p></li><li><p>Appendix:</p></li><li><p>Related Technologies</p></li><li><p>Index</p></li></ul></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Sometimes the simplest answer is the best. Many Enterprise Java developers, accustomed to dealing with Java's spiraling complexity, have fallen into the habit of choosing overly complicated solutions to problems when simpler options are available. Building server applications with \"heavyweight\" Java-based architectures, such as WebLogic, JBoss, and WebSphere, can be costly and cumbersome. When you've reached the point where you spend more time writing code to support your chosen framework than to solve your actual problems, it's time to think in terms of simplicity.In <i>Better, Faster, Lighter Java</i>, authors Bruce Tate and Justin Gehtland argue that the old heavyweight architectures are unwieldy, complicated, and contribute to slow and buggy application code.  As an alternative means for building better applications, the authors present two \"lightweight\" open source architectures: Hibernate--a persistence framework that does its job with a minimal API and gets out of the way, and Spring--a container that's not invasive, heavy or complicated.Hibernate and Spring are designed to be fairly simple to learn and use, and place reasonable demands on system resources. <i>Better, Faster, Lighter Java</i> shows you how they can help you create enterprise applications that are easier to maintain, write, and debug, and are ultimately much faster.Written for intermediate to advanced Java developers, <i>Better, Faster, Lighter Java</i>, offers fresh ideas--often unorthodox--to help you rethink the way you work, and techniques and principles you'll use to build simpler applications.  You'll learn to spend more time on what's important. When you're finished with this book, you'll find that your Java is better, faster, and lighter than ever before.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>The traditional division of labor between the database (which only stores and manages SQL and XML data for fast, easy data search and retrieval) and the application server (which runs application or business logic, and presentation logic) is obsolete. Although the books primary focus is on programming the Oracle Database, the concepts and techniques provided apply to most RDBMS that support Java including Oracle, DB2, Sybase, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. This is the first book to cover new Java, JDBC, SQLJ, JPublisher and Web Services features in Oracle Database 10g Release 2 (the coverage starts with Oracle 9i Release 2). This book is a must-read for database developers audience (DBAs, database applications developers, data architects),   Java developers  (JDBC, SQLJ, J2EE, and OR Mapping frameworks), and to the emerging Web Services assemblers.<br/><br/>* Describes pragmatic solutions, advanced database applications, as well as provision of a wealth of code samples  <br/>* Addresses programming models which run within the database as well as programming models which run in middle-tier or client-tier against the database.<br/>* Discusses languages for stored procedures: when to use proprietary languages such as PL/SQL and when to use standard languages such as Java; also running non-Java scripting languages in the database<br/>* Describes the Java runtime in the Oracle database 10g (i.e., OracleJVM), its architecture, memory management, security management, threading, Java execution, the Native Compiler (i.e., NCOMP), how to make Java known to SQL and PL/SQL, data types mapping, how to call-out to external Web components, EJB components, ERP frameworks, and external databases.<br/>* Describes JDBC programming and the new Oracle JDBC 10g features, its advanced connection services (pooling, failover, load-balancing, and the fast database event notification mechanism) for clustered databases (RAC) in  Grid environments.<br/>* Describes SQLJ programming and the latest Oracle SQLJ 10g features , contrasting it with JDBC <br/>* Describes the latest Database Web services features, Web services concepts and Services Oriented Architecture (SOA) for DBA, the database as Web services provider and the database as Web services consumer.<br/>* Abridged coverage of JPublisher 10g, a versatile complement to JDBC, SQLJ and Database Web Services.</span>",

			"description": "<span>\n    GOLD MEDALIST OF FOREWORD REVIEWS' 2015 INDIEFAB AWARDS IN WOMEN'S STUDIES<br/><br/>What's wrong with black women? Not a damned thing!<br/><br/>The Sisters Are Alright exposes anti–black-woman propaganda and shows how real black women are pushing back against distorted cartoon versions of themselves. <br/><br/>When African women arrived on American shores, the three-headed hydra—servile Mammy, angry Sapphire, and lascivious Jezebel—followed close behind. In the '60s, the Matriarch, the willfully unmarried baby machine leeching off the state, joined them. These stereotypes persist to this day through newspaper headlines, Sunday sermons, social media memes, cable punditry, government policies, and hit song lyrics. Emancipation may have happened more than 150 years ago, but America still won't let a sister be free from this coven of caricatures.<br/><br/>Tamara Winfrey Harris delves into marriage, motherhood, health, sexuality, beauty, and more, taking sharp aim at pervasive stereotypes about black women. She counters warped prejudices with the straight-up truth about being a black woman in America. “We have facets like diamonds,” she writes. “The trouble is the people who refuse to see us sparkling.”\n  </span>",

In the process, it\ndetails the fundamental structures of the Java 2 language and most\nof its core libraries and utilities. The book covers\nobject-orientation, software design, structured programming,\ngraphical user interfacing, event-driven programming, networking,\nand an introduction to data structures.  Java Gently gets\nstudents started on meaningful input/output in an object-oriented\nway without hiding basic concepts. Applets, multimedia, graphics,\nand networking are introduced as students encounter and can handle\nclasses, objects, instantiation, and inheirtance.  The\ntextbook's excellent pedagogy reinforces understanding and\ndemonstrates good programming practice. The three kinds of diagrams\ninclude class, form, and algorithm diagrams. The fully worked\nexamples have been carefully chosen to illustrate recently\nintroduced concepts and solve real-world problems in a\nuser-friendly manner.

			"description": "<span><span><p><b><em>Beginning Java 7</em></b> guides you through version 7 of the Java language and a wide assortment of platform APIs. New Java 7 language features that are discussed include switch-on-string and try-with-resources. APIs that are discussed include Threading, the Collections Framework, the Concurrency Utilities, Swing, Java 2D, networking, JDBC, SAX, DOM, StAX, XPath, JAX-WS, and SAAJ. This book also presents an introduction to Android app development so that you can apply some of its knowledge to the exciting world of Android app development.</p><p>This book presents the following table of contents:</p><p>Chapter 1 introduces you to Java and begins to cover the Java language by focusing on fundamental concepts such as comments, identifiers, variables, expressions, and statements.</p><p>Chapter 2 continues to explore this language by presenting all of its features for working with classes and objects. You learn about features related to class declaration and object creation, encapsulation, information hiding, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and garbage collection.</p><p>Chapter 3 focuses on the more advanced language features related to nested classes, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Additional chapters introduce you to the few features not covered in Chapters 1</p><p>through 3.</p><p>Chapter 4 largely moves away from covering language features (although it does introduce class literals and strictfp) while focusing on language-oriented APIs. You learn about Math, StrictMath, Package, Primitive Type Wrapper Classes, Reference, Reflection, String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder, Threading, BigDecimal, and BigInteger in this chapter.</p><p>Chapter 5 begins to explore Java's utility APIs by focusing largely on the Collections Framework. However, it also discusses legacy collection-oriented APIs and how to create your own collections.</p><p>Chapter 6 continues to focus on utility APIs by presenting the concurrency utilities along with the Objects and Random classes.</p><p>Chapter 7 moves you away from the command-line user interfaces that appear in previous chapters and toward graphical user interfaces. You first learn about the Abstract Window Toolkit foundation, and then explore the Java Foundation Classes in</p><p>terms of Swing and Java 2D. Appendix C explores Accessibility and Drag and Drop.</p><p>Chapter 8 explores filesystem-oriented I/O in terms of the File, RandomAccessFile, stream, and writer/reader classes.</p><p>Chapter 9 introduces you to Java's network APIs (e.g., sockets). It also introduces you to the JDBC API for interacting with databases along with the Java DB database product.</p><p>Chapter 10 dives into Java's XML support by first presenting an introduction to XML (including DTDs and schemas). It next explores the SAX, DOM, StAX, XPath, and XSLT APIs. It even briefly touches on the Validation API. While exploring XPath, you encounter namespace contexts, extension functions and function resolvers, and variables and variable resolvers.</p><p>Chapter 11 introduces you to Java's support for SOAP-based and RESTful web services. As well as providing you with the basics of these web service categories, Chapter 11 presents some advanced topics, such as working with the SAAJ API to communicate</p><p>with a SOAP-based web service without having to rely on JAX-WS. You will appreciate having learned about XML in Chapter 10 before diving into this chapter.</p><p>Chapter 12 helps you put to use some of the knowledge you've gathered in previous chapters by showing you how to use Java to write an Android app's source code. This chapter introduces you to Android, discusses its architecture, shows you how to</p><p>install necessary tools, and develops a simple app.</p><p>Appendix A presents the solutions to the programming exercises that appear near the end of Chapters 1 through 12.</p><p>Appendix B introduces you to Java's Scripting API along with Java 7's support for dynamically typed languages.</p><p>Appendix C introduces you to additional APIs and architecture topics. Examples include Accessibility, classloaders, Console, Drag and Drop, Java Native Interface, and System Tray.</p><p>Appendix D presents a gallery of significant applications that demonstrate various aspects of Java.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are limits to how much knowledge can be crammed into a print book. For this reason, Appendixes A, B, C, and D are not included in this book's pages. Instead, these appendixes are freely distributed as PDF files. Appendixes A and B are bundled with the book's associated code file at the Apress website (<code>http://www.apress.com/9781430239093</code>). Appendixes C and D are bundled with their respective code files at my TutorTutor.ca website (<code>http://tutortutor.ca/cgi-bin/makepage.cgi?/books/bj7</code>).</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>The entire Java language, including Java 7-specific features such as switch on string, try-with-resources, final rethrow, multicatch, and SafeVarargs</p></li><li><p>A huge assortment of Java 7 APIs, beginning with those APIs oriented toward the language itself, and including Java</p></li><li><p>7-specific APIs such as the Fork/Join Framework, Objects, and JLayer</p></li><li><p>Various Java 7 tools, starting with the javac compiler and java application launcher</p></li><li><p>How to create user interfaces, working with web services, and a whole lot more</p></li><li><p>The basics of getting started with Android app development</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book targets the following groups of developers:</p><li><p>Newcomers, skilled (to some degree) in other programming languages but with no previous exposure to Java</p></li><li><p>Intermediate Java developers, skilled in the fundamentals of Java prior to Java 7 and looking to increase their understanding of Java 7 language/API changes</p></li><li><p>All developers looking beyond standard Java, who want to leverage Java 7 to create mobile apps via Android</p></li><li><p>Even advanced Java developers may find a few items of interest.</p></li></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><strong>Learning Java Through Games</strong> teaches students how to use the different features of the Java language as well as how to program. Suitable for self-study or as part of a two-course introduction to programming, the book covers as much material as possible from the latest Java standard while requiring no previous programming experience. </p><p/><p>Taking an application-motivated approach, the text presents an abundance of games. Students must read through the whole chapter to understand all the features that are needed to implement the game. Most chapters start with a description of a game and then introduce different Java constructs for implementing the features of the game on need-to-use bases. </p><p/><p>The text teaches students not only how to write code that works but also how to follow good software practices. All sample programs in the text strive to achieve low cohesion and high coupling—the hallmarks of well-designed code. Many programs are refactored multiple times to achieve code that is easy to understand, reuse, and maintain.</p><p/><p>The first part of the book covers basic programming techniques, such as conditional statements, loops, methods, arrays, and classes. The second part focuses on more advanced topics, including class inheritance, recursions, sorting algorithms, GUI programming, exception handling, files, and applets. </p></span>",

Anyone involved with\nInternet development, where Java<sup>(TM)</sup> technology is\nprominent, or in enterprise information systems must understand how\nto use Java technology--especially the Directory SDK for Java--in\norder to unlock the power of LDAP.</p><p>Written by the designer of the Directory SDK for Java and by a\nleading implementor of directory-based solutions, <b><em>LDAP\nProgramming with Java<sup>(TM)</sup></em></b> is the first accurate,\nconcise, and complete guide on accessing LDAP from Java\napplications. Assuming familiarity with Java programming, the book\nprovides a comprehensive discussion of LDAP, from basic directory\nconcepts to the most advanced techniques. It collects in one\nconvenient resource the many innovative and experience-based\ntechniques and approaches programmers have discovered for using the\nDirectory SDK to solve LDAP access challenges.</p><p>If you are new to LDAP, you will find helpful background\ninformation about the role of directories in today's software\nsystems; LDAP methods of storing, accessing, searching, and\nupdating data; and how the Directory SDK for Java helps\napplications gain access to an LDAP server. Once you have become\nproficient with the essential concepts and techniques, you can move\non to detailed material about authentication, LDAP and\nJavaScript<sup>(TM)</sup>, working with JavaBeans<sup>(TM)</sup>\nfor reusable LDAP components, expressing data relationships in a\ndirectory, and other advanced LDAP subjects.</p><p>Specific topics covered include:</p><li><p>The LDAP naming and information models</p></li><li><p>The command-line tools of the SDK</p></li><li><p>Authentication with a password, SSL, and SASL</p></li><li><p>Configuring access control</p></li><li><p>Writing LDAP applets for a browser</p></li><li><p>Accessing the SDK from JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Storing configuration and preferences in a directory</p></li><li><p>Encapsulating LDAP functionality in a JavaBean</p></li><li><p>Using LDAP in Java servlets</p></li><li><p>LDAP URLs</p></li><li><p>Multiple threads and multiple connections</p></li><li><p>Referrals and replicated systems</p></li><li><p>LDAP controls</p></li><li><p>Synchronous and asynchronous operations</p></li><li><p>Performance tips</p></li><p><em><b>LDAP Programming with Java<sup>(TM)</sup></b></em> also\npresents numerous examples, from simple code snippets to complete\ncomponents and applications.</p></span></span></span>",

			"title": "Java Data Objects",
			"description": "<span><span><div><p>Java Data Objects revolutionizes the way Java developers interact with databases and other datastores.  JDO allows you to store and retrieve objects in a way that's natural to Java programmers.  Instead of working with JDBC or EJB's container-managed persistence, you work directly with your Java objects. You don't have to copy data to and from database tables or issue SELECTs to perform queries: your JDO implementation takes care of persistence behind-the-scenes, and you make queries based on the fields of your Java objects, using normal Java syntax.</p><p>The result is software that is truly object-oriented: not code that is partially object-oriented, with a large database-shaped lump on the back end.  JDO lets you save plain, ordinary Java objects, and does not force you to use different data models and types for dealing with storage.  As a result, your code becomes easier to maintain, easier to re-use, and easier to test.  And you're not tied to a specific database vendor: your JDO code is entirely database-independent.  You don't even need to know whether the datastore is a relational database, an object database, or just a set of files.</p><p>This book, written by the JDO Specification Lead and one of the key contributors to the JDO Specification, is the definitive work on the JDO API.  It gives you a thorough introduction to JDO, starting with a simple application that demonstrates many of JDO's capabilities.  It shows you how to make classes persistent, how JDO maps persistent classes to the database, how to configure JDO at runtime, how to perform transactions, and how to make queries.  More advanced chapters cover optional features such as nontransactional access and optimistic transactions.  The book concludes by discussing the use of JDO in web applications and J2EE environments.</p><p>Whether you only want to read up on an interesting new technology, or are seriously considering an alternative to JDBC or EJB CMP, you'll find that this book is essential.  It provides by far the most authoritative and complete coverage available.</p></div></span></span>",

Using Carbon, you don't have to\nrewrite your Mac OS programs entirely to get them to take advantage\nof the new features in Mac OS X. Instead, all you have to rewrite\nis the 10 to 20 percent of the code that can't be translated to OS\nX. For C programmers, Apple's Carbon is the essential building\nblock for applications on Mac OS X. With Carbon, you can use\nsimple, traditional C interfaces to create world-class applications\nfor a world-class operating system. After orienting you with a\ndetailed tour of a Carbon application, <em>Learning Carbon</em> walks\nyou through the entire process of designing and creating a complete\nCarbon application called Moon Travel Planner. Along the way,\nyou'll be introduced to two pivotal development tools: Project\nBuilder and Interface Builder. You'll learn key concepts about\nCarbon and Mac OS X programming, including event management,\nresource handling, and bundle anatomy. And you'll get direct,\nhands-on instruction on how to implement essential application\ntasks, such as managing windows, printing documents, opening and\nsaving files, creating and responding to menu commands, providing\nuser help, and organizing your application for easy localization in\nmultiple countries and languages.

This strategic guide covers:</p><ul><li>How the Clinic's leaders redefined the concept of patient experience and developed a strategy to improve it</li><li>Critical lessons learned regarding organization, recruitment, training, and measuring service excellence</li><li>Ways in which the Clinic aligned its entire workforce around its Patients First strategy</li><li>How leaders improved the critical element of physician communication</li></ul><p/><p>Rather than view patients simply as sick people who need treatment, Cleveland Clinic sees them also as important stakeholders in the organization's success.

			"title": "QuickTime for Java: A Developer's Notebook",
			"description": "<span><span><span><p>\nQuickTime Java (QJT) is a terrific multimedia toolkit, but it's\nalso terrifying to the uninitiated. Java developers who need to add\naudio, video, or interactive media creation and playback to their\napplications find that QTJ is powerful, but not easy to get into.\nIn fact, when it comes to class-count, QuickTime Java is nearly as\nlarge as all of Java 1.1. Once you learn the entire scope of\nApple's QuickTime software, you really appreciate the problem. At\nits simplest, QuickTime allows Mac and Windows users to play audio\nand video on their computers. But QuickTime is many things: a file\nformat, an environment for media authoring, and a suite of\napplications that includes browser plug-ins for viewing media\nwithin a web page, a PictureViewer for working with still pictures,\nQuickTime Streaming Server for delivering streaming media files on\nthe Internet in real time, and QuickTime Broadcaster for delivering\nlive events on the Internet. Among others. As if that weren't\ndaunting enough, the javadocs on QJT are wildly incomplete, and\nother books on the topic are long out of date and not well\nregarded, making progress with QTJ extremely difficult. So what can\nyou do? Our new hands-on guide, <em>QuickTime Java: A Developer's\nNotebook</em>, not only catches up with this technology, but\nde-mystifies it. This practical \"all lab, no lecture\" book is an\ninformal, code-intensive workbook that offers the first real look\nat this important software. Like other titles in our Developer's\nNotebook series, <em>QuickTime Java: A Developer's Notebook</em> is\nfor impatient early adopters who want get up to speed on what they\ncan use right now. It's deliberately light on theory, emphasizing\nexample over explanation and practice over concept, so you can\nfocus on learning by doing. <em>QuickTime Java: A Developer's\nNotebook</em> gives you just the functionality you need from QTJ.\nEven if you come to realize that 95% of the API is irrelevant to\nyou, this book will help you master the 5% that really counts.\n</p></span></span></span>",

With\nover a hundred substantial changes to the core language, as well as\nnumerous library and API additions, developers have a variety of\nnew features, facilities, and techniques available. But with so\nmany changes, where do you start? You could read through the\nlengthy, often boring language specification; you could wait for\nthe latest 500 page tome on concepts and theory; you could even\nplay around with the new JDK, hoping you figure things out--or you\ncan get straight to work with <em>Java 5.0 Tiger: A Developer's\nNotebook</em>. This no-nonsense, down-and-dirty guide by bestselling\nJava authors Brett McLaughlin and David Flanagan skips all the\nboring prose and lecture, and jumps right into Tiger. You'll have a\nhandle on the important new features of the language by the end of\nthe first chapter, and be neck-deep in code before you hit the\nhalfway point. Using the task-oriented format of this new series,\nyou'll get complete practical coverage of generics, learn how\nboxing and unboxing affects your type conversions, understand the\npower of varargs, learn how to write enumerated types and\nannotations, master Java's new formatting methods and the for/in\nloop, and even get a grip on concurrency in the JVM. Light on\ntheory and long on practical application, <em>Java 5.0 Tiger: A\nDeveloper's Notebook</em> allows you to cut to the chase, getting\nstraight to work with Tiger's new features. The new Developer's\nNotebooks series from O'Reilly covers important new tools for\nsoftware developers. Emphasizing example over explanation and\npractice over theory, they focus on learning by doing--you'll get\nthe goods straight from the masters, in an informal and\ncode-intensive style that suits developers. If you've been curious\nabout Tiger, but haven't known where to start, this no-fluff,\nlab-style guide is the solution.\n</p></span></span></span></span>",

BPEL and web services are both clamped into Service-oriented Architecture (SOA). Development of efficient SOA composites too often requires usage of other technologies or languages, like Java. This Cookbook explains through the use of examples how to efficiently integrate BPEL with custom Java functionality.</p><p>If you need to use BPEL programming to develop web services in SOA development, this book is for you.</p><p>BPEL and Java Cookbook will show you how to efficiently integrate custom Java functionality into BPEL processes. Based on practical examples, this book shows you the solutions to a number of issues developers come across when designing SOA composite applications. The integration between the two technologies is shown two-fold; the book focuses on the ways that Java utilizes the BPEL and vice-versa.</p><p>With this book, you will take a journey through a number of recipes that solve particular problems with developing SOA composite applications. Each chapter works on a different set of recipes in a specific area. The recipes cover the whole lifecycle of developing SOA composites: from specification, through design, testing and deployment.</p><p>BPEL and Java Cookbook starts off with recipes that cover initiation of BPEL from Java and vice-versa. It then moves on to logging and tracing facilities, validation and transformation of BPEL servers, embedding of third-party Java libraries into BPEL. It also covers manipulation with variables in BPEL different techniques of Java code wrapping for web service usage and utilization of XML façades.</p><p>After reading BPEL and Java Cookbook you will be able to circumvent many of the issues that developers experience during SOA composite application development.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Biochar, a biomass that is burned at very high temperature in the absence of oxygen, has recently become an interesting subject of study. Biochar is highly stable and does not degrade; it possesses physical properties that assist in retention of nutrients in the soil. The use of biochar will undoubtedly have a significant impact not only on soil nutrients but also on soil organism communities and their functions.<br/><br/>This book focuses on how the ecology and biology of soil organisms is affected by the addition of biochar to soils. It takes into account direct and indirect effects of biochar addition to soils, on the soil carbon cycle, impact on plant resistance to foliar and soilborne disease, interactions with pathogenic, mycorhizal and saprophytic fungi. The stability of biochar in soil environment is also discussed. Special focus has been put on application of biochar to remediate polluted soils, taking into account possible toxic effects of biochar on soil fauna. </p><p>This book will be useful to students and researchers in agronomy, biology, ecology, and environmental managers from both academic as well as industrial organizations.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p><em>Mac OS X for Java Geeks</em> delivers a complete and detailed\nlook at the Mac OS X platform, geared specifically at Java\ndevelopers. Programmers using the 10.2 (Jaguar) release of Mac OS\nX, and the new JDK 1.4, have unprecedented new functionality\navailable to them. Whether you are a Java newbie, working your way\nthrough Java Swing and classpath issues, or you are a Java guru,\ncomfortable with digital media, reflection, and J2EE, this book\nwill teach you how to get around on Mac OS X. You'll also get the\nlatest information on how to build applications that run\nseamlessly, and identically, on Windows, Linux, Unix, and the Mac.\nThe book begins by laying out the Mac OS X tool set, from the\nincluded Java Runtime Environment to third-party tools IDEs and\nJakarta Ant. You'll then be brought up to speed on the advanced,\nMac-specific extensions to Java, including the spelling framework,\nspeech framework, and integration with QuickTime. In addition to\nclear explanations of these extensions, you'll learn how to write\ncode that falls back to non-Mac specific code when it runs on other\nplatforms, keeping your application portable. Once you have the\nfundamentals of the Mac OS X Java platform in hand, this book takes\nyou beyond the basics. You'll learn how to get the Apache web\nserver running, and supplement it with the Jakarta Tomcat JSP and\nservlet container. JSPs and servlets running on Mac OS X are\ncovered, as is installation and connectivity to a database. Once\nyou have your web applications up and running, you'll learn how to\ninterface them with EJBs, as running the JBoss application server\non Mac OS X is covered. Finally, the latest developments in web\nservices, including XML-RPC and SOAP, are found within.\n</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Android development is hot, and many programmers are interested in joining the fun. However, because this technology is based on Java, you should first obtain a solid grasp of the Java language and its foundational APIs to improve your chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. After all, you will be busy learning the architecture of an Android app, the various Android-specific APIs, and Android-specific tools. If you do not already know Java fundamentals, you will probably end up with a massive headache from also having to quickly cram those fundamentals into your knowledge base.</p><p><b><em>Learn Java for Android Development, Second Edition</em></b> teaches programmers of any skill level the essential Java language and foundational Java API skills that must be learned to improve the programmer's chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. Each of the book's 14 chapters provides an exercise section that gives you the opportunity to reinforce your understanding of the chapter's material. Answers to the book's more than 500 exercises are provided in an appendix. A second appendix provides a significant game-oriented Java application, which you can convert into an Android app. </p><p>Once you complete this book, you should be ready to dive into beginning Android app development.  Maybe, start that journey with Apress' <em>Beginning Android</em>.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p><b>The Java language:</b> This book provides complete coverage of nearly every pre-Java version 7 language feature (native methods are briefly mentioned but not formally covered). Starting with basic language features (e.g., comments, types, expressions, and statements), you progress to those features related to classes and objects, followed by object-oriented features related to inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. You then explore the advanced language features for nested types, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Continuing, you investigate strictfp, synchronized, volatile, the enhanced for loop statement, autoboxing/unboxing, and transient fields.</p></li><li><p><b>Java APIs:</b> In addition to Object and APIs related to exceptions, you explore Math, StrictMath, BigDecimal, BigInteger, String, StringBuffer/StringBuilder, Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Number, the Threads API, System, Runtime, Process, the Collections Framework, the Concurrency Utilities, Date, Formatter, Random, Scanner, the ZIP and JAR APIs, File, RandomAccessFile, stream classes, and writer/reader classes, InetAddress, SocketOptions, Socket, ServerSocket, DatagramSocket, MulticastSocket, URL, URLConnection, URLEncoder, URLDecoder, NetWorkInterface, InterfaceAddress, CookieHandler, CookieManager, CookieStore, CookiePolicy, Buffer, ByteBuffer, CharBuffer, DoubleBuffer,FloatBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer, ShortBuffer, MappedByteBuffer, Channel, WritableByteChannel, ReadableByteChannel,ScatteringByteChannel, GatheringByteChannel, FileChannel, the Regular Expressions API, JDBC, and more.</p></li><li><p><b>Applying these:</b> You will learn how to use the JDK's javac (compiler), java (application launcher), javadoc (Java documentation generator), and jar (Java archive creator, updater, and extractor) tools. You will also receive an introduction to the Eclipse integrated development environment, which is the official standard for developing Android apps.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for any programmer - including existing Java programmers and Objective-C-based iPhone and iPad programmers - of any skill level who needs to obtain a solid understanding of the Java language and foundational Java APIs before jumping into Android app development.</p></span></span>",

Written to address performance policies within state and national governments, <strong>Government Performance and Results: An Evaluation of GPRA’s First Decade</strong> summarizes lessons learned from a 10-year research project that evaluated performance reports produced by federal agencies under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). The results of this project can help answer a wide variety of questions in political economy and public administration, such as:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>What factors make performance reports relevant and informative?</li><li>Has the quality of information disclosed to the public improved?</li><li>Why do some agencies produce better reports than others?</li><li>Has GPRA led to greater availability and use of performance information by federal managers?</li><li>Has GPRA led to greater use of performance information in budget decisions?</li><li>What steps would make federal management and budget decisions more performance oriented?</li><p/></ul><p>The book documents the current state of the art in federal performance reporting, measures the extent of improvement, compares federal performance reports with those produced by state governments and other nations, and suggests how GPRA has affected management of federal agencies and resource allocation by policymakers. It also identifies obstacles that must be overcome if GPRA is to deliver on the promise of performance budgeting. The authors chronicle the improvements observed in federal performance reporting through the lens of the Mercatus Center’s annual <em>Performance Report Scorecard.</em></p><p>As budget shortfalls and new debt burdens increase interest in public management and budgeting techniques that allow governments to do more with less, this is an appropriate time to take stock of what GPRA has accomplished and what remains to be done. By comparing best performance reporting practices in the US federal government with those in states and other countries, this book speeds the diffusion of useful knowledge at a critical time.</p></span>",

He's drawn on their experiences, his own as a veteran environmental activist, and that of a hand-picked group of seasoned activists to produce an accessible, eminently practical, inspiring guide on how to work effectively for change in any environment.</p><p>Stick Your Neck Out covers every aspect of working for change, from choosing an issue to mapping out a strategy, getting a team together, building alliances, working with the media, and more. Each chapter contains a series of practical tips as well as inspiring examples of real people--artists, truck drivers, doctors, waitresses, and others--who have made a difference on issues like poverty, racism, gang violence, environmental pollution, and many more. Everything in this book has been honed and practiced; nothing is untested theory.</p><p>This is a comprehensive guide to the skills, qualities, and strategies you need to make a difference on any issue. But it's also about becoming fully alive--about the meaning and passion you can add to your own life by getting involved. Active citizenship and personal growth are linked. The information in this book can change your world--and it can change your life.</p></span>",

We begin by\noutlining the many advantages of its multi-threaded operation over\nthe pooled JVM function of earlier releases. The Open Services\nGateway initiative (OSGi) is described and we highlight the\nbenefits OSGi brings to both development and deployment.</p><p>Details are then provided about how to configure and use the new\nJVM server environment. Examples are included of the deployment\nprocess, which takes a Java application from the workstation\nEclipse integrated development environment (IDE) with the IBM CICS\nExplorer® software development kit (SDK) plug-in, through the\nvarious stages up to execution in a stand-alone CICS region and an\nIBM CICSPlex® environment.</p><p>The book continues with a comparison between traditional CICS\nprogramming, and CICS programming from Java. As a result, the main\nfunctional areas of the Java class library for CICS (JCICS)\napplication programming interface (API) are extensively\nreviewed.</p><p>Further chapters are provided to demonstrate interaction with\nstructured data such as copybooks, and how to access relational\ndatabases by using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and Structured\nQuery Language for Java (SQLJ).</p><p>Finally, we devote a chapter to the migration of applications\nfrom the pooled JVM model to the new JVM server run time.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span>\n    Develop modular applications using the Java Platform Module System, the single most anticipated feature in Java 9. You will improve maintainability and performance of your Java applications by deploying only modules that are needed and encapsulating their implementation details. <div><div><br/></div><div>Until now Java has been monolithic. Using any one part of Java has meant incorporating the entirety of the runtime environment, an approach ill-suited to the increasing number of IoT devices such as fitness monitors, kitchen appliances, toys and games, and so forth. This book shows a new way, to make Java scale from the smallest of footprints in the smallest of devices through desktop PCs and on up to server platforms. </div><div><br/></div><div>With <i>Java 9 Modularity </i><i>Revealed</i> you will learn to make your projects more reliable and scalable than ever using the most important feature in Java 9—The Java Platform Module System, known more commonly as Project Jigs</div></div>aw. You will learn how to avoid one of the major pain points of Java programming, that of conflicting class names from different modules, or packages. You will learn to create custom run-time images that represent a minimal and more compact JRE containing only those modules that you need. You will further learn to migrate existing Java applications to modular ones using different approaches and tools. The end result is a new ability to plug together different modules without fear of namespace and other conflicts, and you can deploy to everything from small devices to large servers. <div><br/></div><div>This book provides code examples and explanations.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>What You'll Learn </b></div><div><ul><li>Build Java applications using the new modular system introduced in Java 9 <br/></li><li>Create your own JRE consisting only of the modules that you require <br/></li><li>Adapt your testing techniques toward modular applications</li>lare your dependencies on other modules <li>Enable modules to export only specific packages <br/></li><li>Migrate existing Java applications to modular ones <br/></li><li>Improve maintainability and performance of Java applications</li></ul><b><br/></b><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><br/></div><div>Experienced Java programmers wanting to keep up and become informed on the new modularity support in Java 9</div>\n  </span></span></span>",

Exploring well beyond the media-manufactured boundaries of Left and Right, <em>Most Likely To Secede</em> advocates for a 21st century world in which collective decisions about finance, fuel, food, and culture are removed from a centralized corporate imperial United States, and returned to regional and local control. As the only state to once exist as its own republic, Vermont is uniquely poised to lead a national conversation on 2st century decentralization, and <em>Most Likely To Secede</em> shows us the way.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Beginning with IBM® CICS® Version 2, applications can run on TCBs apart from the QR TCB, which has positive implications for improving system throughput and for implementing new technologies inside of CICS. Examples of implementing new technologies include using the IBM MVS™ Java virtual machine (JVM) inside CICS and enabling listener tasks written for other platforms to be imported to run under CICS.</p><p>The newest release, CICS Transaction Server for z/OS® (CICS TS) V4.2, includes scalability enhancements so that you can perform more work more quickly in a single CICS system. The advantage of this enhancement is that you can increase vertical scaling and decrease the need to scale horizontally, reducing the number of regions that are required to run the production business applications. The scalability enhancements in CICS TS V4.2 fall into two broad areas, which are increased usage of open transaction environment (OTE) and of 64-bit storage.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks® publication is a comprehensive guide to threadsafe concepts and implementation for IBM CICS. This book explains how systems programmers, applications developers, and architects can implement threadsafe applications in an environment. It describes the real-world experiences of users, and our own experiences, of migrating applications to be threadsafe. This book also highlights the two most critical aspects of threadsafe applications: system performance and integrity.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Android development is hot, and many programmers are interested in joining the fun. However, because this technology is based on Java, you should first obtain a solid grasp of the Java language and its foundational APIs to improve your chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. After all, you will be busy learning the architecture of an Android app, the various Android-specific APIs, and Android-specific tools. If you do not already know Java fundamentals, you will probably end up with a massive headache from also having to quickly cram those fundamentals into your knowledge base.</p><p><em>Learn Java for Android Development</em> teaches programmers of any skill level the essential Java language and foundational Java API skills that must be learned to improve the programmer's chances of succeeding as an Android app developer. Each of the book's 10 chapters provides an exercise section that gives you the opportunity to reinforce your understanding of the chapter's material. Answers to the book's more than 300 exercises are provided in an appendix. Additionally, author <b>Jeff Friesen</b> has created six bonus chapters that you can download from his personal site, located at <code>http://tutortutor.ca/cgi-bin/makepage.cgi?/books/ljfad</code>.</p><p>Once you complete this book, you will be ready to dive into Android, and you can start that journey by obtaining a copy of <em>Beginning Android 2</em>.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>The Java language: This book provides complete coverage of nearly every pre-Java version 7 language feature (native methods are briefly mentioned but not formally covered). Starting with those features related to classes and objects, you progress to object-oriented features related to inheritance, polymorphism, and interfaces. You then explore the advanced language features for nested types, packages, static imports, exceptions, assertions, annotations, generics, and enums. Continuing, you investigate strictfp, class literals, synchronized, volatile, the enhanced for loop statement, autoboxing/unboxing, and transient fields. The book also briefly presents most (if not all) of Java version 7's language features, although not much is said about closures or modules (which were not finalized at the time of writing).</p></li><li><p>Java APIs: In addition to Object and APIs related to exceptions, you explore Math, StrictMath, BigDecimal, BigInteger, Package, Boolean, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Number, the References API, the Reflection API, String, StringBuffer, System, the Threading API, the collections framework, the concurrency utilities, the internationalization APIs, the Preferences API, Random, the Regular Expressions API, File, RandomAccessFile, stream classes, and writer/reader classes. You will also get a tiny taste of Swing in the context of internationalization.</p></li><li><p>Tools: You will learn how to use the JDK's javac (compiler), java (application launcher), javadoc (Java documentation generator), and jar (Java archive creator, updater, and extractor) tools. You will also receive an introduction to the NetBeans and Eclipse integrated development environments. Although you can develop Android apps without NetBeans or Eclipse, working with these IDEs is much more pleasant.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for any programmer (including existing Java programmers and Objective-C [iPhone/iPad] programmers) of any skill level who needs to obtain a solid understanding of the Java language and foundational Java APIs before jumping into Android app development.</p></span></span>",

They can then write and debug their applications in\nEGL, and the Java code will be generated for them. So they can then\nbuild dynamic Web applications without having to learn the Java\nlanguage. This provides significant advantages, enabling clients to\nminimize application development time and resource\nrequirements.</p><p>We give you an overview of EGL, its concepts and operations, and\nwalk you through a step-by-step tutorial to develop an simple Web\napplication. Included is an overview of the 4GL to EGL migration\nprocess and a sample application migration. You will be alerted to\npotential migration issues, and given the information to resolve\nthem.</p><p>We also include guidance for working with special database\nbehavior and requirements, JasperReports, and a number of advanced\nEGL topics for developing robust and individualized\napplications.</p></span>",

Don't Retire asks readers the all-important question: as you look at the years ahead, what can you do to make them satisfying and meaningful? <br/><br/>Ken Blanchard and Morton Shaevitz point out that some people see their later years as a time to endure rather than as an exciting opportunity. Both research and common sense confirm that people who embrace these years with energy and gusto—rather than withdrawing and waiting for things to happen—consistently make the rest of their lives the best of their lives.<br/><br/>In the trademark Ken Blanchard style, the authors tell the compelling story of Larry and Janice Sparks, who discover how to see each day as an opportunity to enhance their relationships, stimulate their minds, revitalize their bodies, and grow spiritually. As they learn to be open to new experiences, Larry and Janice rekindle passion in every area of their lives. <br/><br/>Readers will find humor, practical information, and profound wisdom in Refire! Don't Retire. Best of all, they will be inspired to make all the years ahead truly worth living. \n  </span>",

Today, they ask, “Just how large\ncan we scale virtualized Java application platforms, and just how\nefficiently can we tune them?” Now, the leading expert on\nJava virtualization answers these questions, offering detailed\ntechnical information you can apply in any production or QA/test\nenvironment.</p><p>Emad Benjamin has spent nine years\nvirtualizing VMware’s own enterprise Java applications and\nworking with nearly 300 leading VMware customers on projects of all\ntypes and sizes—from 100 JVMs to 10,000+, with heaps from 1GB\nto 360GB, and including massive big-data applications built on\nclustered JVMs. Reflecting all this experience, he shows you how to\nsuccessfully size and tune any Java workload.</p><p>This reference and performance\n“cookbook” identifies high-value optimization\nopportunities that apply to physical environments, virtual\nenvironments, or both. You learn how to rationalize and scale\nexisting Java infrastructure, modernize architecture for new\napplications, and systematically benchmark and improve every aspect\nof virtualized Java performance. Throughout, Benjamin offers real\nperformance studies, specific advice, and\n“from-the-trenches” insights into monitoring and\ntroubleshooting.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><p>--Performance issues associated with\nlarge-scale Java platforms, including consolidation, elasticity,\nand flexibility</p><p>--Technical considerations arising from\ntheoretical and practical limits of Java platforms</p><p>--Building horizontal in-memory databases\nwith VMware vFabric SQLFire to improve scalability and response\ntimes</p><p>--Tuning large-scale Java using\nthroughput/parallel GC and Concurrent Mark and Sweep (CMS)\ntechniques</p><p>--Designing and sizing a new virtualized\nJava environment</p><p>--Designing and sizing new large-scale Java\nplatforms when migrating from physical to virtualized\ndeployments</p><p>--Designing and sizing large-scale Java\nplatforms for latency-sensitive in-memory databases</p><p>--Real-world performance studies: SQLFire\nvs. RDBMS, Spring-based Java web apps, vFabric SpringTrader,\napplication tiers, data tiers, and more</p><p>--Performance differences between ESXi3,\n4.1, and 5</p><p>--Best-practice considerations for each type\nof workload: architecture, performance, design, sizing, and high\navailability</p><p>--Identifying bottlenecks in the load\nbalancer, web server, Java application server, or DB Server\ntiers</p><p>--Advanced vSphere Java performance\ntroubleshooting with esxtop</p><p>--Performance FAQs: answers to specific\nquestions enterprise customers have asked</p></span></span>",

The second part of\nthis book focuses on providing more advanced sample applications to\ndemonstrate the key capabilities of this toolkit. Many of these\nsamples can then beused as building blocks for your own\napplications.<br/>\nThis book is intended for Java developers who have experience using\nthe Sametime Java client toolkit, and want to use the Sametime\nCommunity Server toolkit to enhance application logic on the server\nside. Those not already familiar with the Lotus Sametime\narchitecture itself, or the Sametime client toolkits, should first\nread the book \"Working with the Sametime Client Toolkits,\"\nSG24-6666. All of the samples in the book are available in source\nformat from the IBM Redbooks Web site.</p><p>Please note that the additional material referenced in the text is not available from IBM.</p></span>",
