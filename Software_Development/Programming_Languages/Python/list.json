In this fully revised edition, explore pytest's superpowers - simple asserts, fixtures, parametrization, markers, and plugins - while creating simple tests and test suites against a small database application. Using a robust yet simple fixture model, it's just as easy to write small tests with pytest as it is to scale up to complex functional testing. This book shows you how.</p><p>pytest is undeniably the best choice for testing Python projects. It's a full-featured, flexible, and extensible testing framework. pytest's fixture model allows you to share test data and setup procedures across multiple layers of tests. The pytest framework gives you powerful features such as assert rewriting, parametrization, markers, plugins, parallel test execution, and clear test failure reporting - with no boilerplate code.</p><p>With simple step-by-step instructions and sample code, this book gets you up to speed quickly on this easy-to-learn yet powerful tool. Write short, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing. Speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use Python's builtin assert statements instead of awkward assert helper functions to make your tests more readable. Move setup code out of tests and into fixtures to separate setup failures from test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, and even existing unittest tests.</p><p>Write simple, maintainable tests quickly with pytest.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The examples in this book were written using Python 3.10 and pytest 7. pytest 7 supports Python 3.5 and above.</p></div></span>",

Add powerful testing features and still speed up test times by distributing tests across multiple processors and running tests in parallel. Use the built-in assert statements to reduce false test failures by separating setup and test failures. Test error conditions and corner cases with expected exception testing, and use one test to run many test cases with parameterized testing. Extend pytest with plugins, connect it to continuous integration systems, and use it in tandem with tox, mock, coverage, unittest, and doctest.</p><p>Write simple, maintainable tests that elegantly express what you're testing and why.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>The examples in this book are written using Python 3.6 and pytest 3.0. However, pytest 3.0 supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and Python 3.3-3.6.</p></div></span></span>",

The skills you learn will boost your ability to program—not just in Python but in any language.</p><p>You’ll learn:</p><p>•Coding style, and how to use Python’s Black auto-formatting tool for cleaner code<br/>•Common sources of bugs, and how to detect them with static analyzers<br/>•How to structure the files in your code projects with the Cookiecutter template tool<br/>•Functional programming techniques like lambda and higher-order functions<br/>•How to profile the speed of your code with Python’s built-in timeit and cProfile modules<br/>•The computer science behind Big-O algorithm analysis<br/>•How to make your comments and docstrings informative, and how often to write them<br/>•How to create classes in object-oriented programming, and why they’re used to organize code</p><p>Toward the end of the book you’ll read a detailed source-code breakdown of two classic command-line games, the Tower of Hanoi (a logic puzzle) and Four-in-a-Row (a two-player tile-dropping game), and a breakdown of how their code follows the book’s best practices. You’ll test your skills by implementing the program yourself.</p><p>Of course, no single book can make you a professional software developer. But <i>Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python</i> will get you further down that path and make you a better programmer in the process as you learn to write readable code that’s easy to debug and perfectly Pythonic.</p></div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>This book builds on basic Python tutorials to explain various Python language features that aren’t routinely covered: from reusable console scripts that play double duty as micro-services by leveraging entry points, to using asyncio efficiently to collate data from a large number of sources. Along the way, it covers type-hint based linting, low-overhead testing and other automated quality checking to demonstrate a robust real-world development process.<div><br/></div><div>Some powerful aspects of Python are often documented with contrived examples that explain the feature as a standalone example only. By following the design and build of a real-world application example from prototype to production quality you'll see not only how the various pieces of functionality work but how they integrate as part of the larger system design process. In addition, you'll benefit from the kind of useful asides and library recommendations that are a staple of conference Q&amp;A sessions at Python conferences as well as discussions of modern Python best practice and techniques to better produce clear code that is easily maintainable.</div><div><br/></div><div><i>Advanced Python Development</i> is intended for developers who can already write simple programs in Python and want to understand when it’s appropriate to use new and advanced language features and to do so in a confident manner.

It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.</p><p>Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception. </p><p>Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.</p><p>You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.</p><p>You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy.</p><p>This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It's also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Throughout the book you will learn key object-oriented programming techniques demonstrated by comprehensive case studies in the context of a larger project.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book. You can download the example code files for all Packt books you have purchased from your account at http://www.PacktPub.com.

			"description": "<span><div><p>Python is growing in popularity; based on download statistics, there are  now over 450,000 people using Python, and more than 150,000 people using Python  on Windows.  Use of the language has been growing at about 40% per year since  1995, and there is every reason to believe that growth will continue.Despite Python's increasing popularity on Windows, <i>Python Programming on  Win32</i> is the first book to demonstrate how to use it as a serious Windows  development and administration tool.  Unlike scripting on Unix, Windows  scripting involves integrating a number of components, such as COM or the  various mail and database APIs, with the Win32 programming interface.   While experienced Windows C++ programmers can find their way through the  various objects, most people need some guidance, and this book is it.

Moreover, Python is easy to learn\nbut powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programming\nchallenges. But what Python programmers have lacked is one concise\nand clear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of\nguidance in how best to use Python's great power. Now <em>Python in\na Nutshell</em> fills this need. In the tradition of O'Reilly's \"In\na Nutshell\" series, this book offers Python programmers one place\nto look when they need help remembering or deciphering the syntax\nof this open source language and its many modules. This\ncomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up all the most\nfrequently needed information--not just about the Python language\nitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard\nlibrary and the most important third-party extensions. <em>Python in\na Nutshell</em> focuses on Python 2.2 (and all its point releases),\ncurrently the most stable and widespread Python release. This book\nincludes:\n</p><ul><li><p>A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language\nitself</p></li><li><p>An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python,\ncovering both the classic and new-style object models</p></li><li><p>Coverage of other core topics, including exceptions, modules,\nstrings, and regular expressions</p></li><li><p>A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functions, as\nwell as the key modules in the Python standard library, including\nsys, os, time, thread, math, and socket, among many others</p></li><li><p>Reference material on important third-party extensions, such as\nNumeric and Tkinter</p></li><li><p>Information about extending Python and embedding it into other\napplications</p></li></ul><p><em>Python in a Nutshell</em> provides a solid, no-nonsense quick\nreference to information that programmers rely on the most.

Thiscomprehensive reference guide makes it easy to look up the mostfrequently needed information--not just about the Python languageitself, but also the most frequently used parts of the standard libraryand the most important third-party extensions. </p><p>Ask any Python aficionado and you'll hear that Python programmers haveit all: an elegant object-oriented language with readable andmaintainable syntax, that allows for easy integration with componentsin C, C++, Java, or C#, and an enormous collection of precoded standardlibrary and third-party extension modules. Moreover, Python is easy tolearn, yet powerful enough to take on the most ambitious programmingchallenges. But what Python programmers used to lack is a concise andclear reference resource, with the appropriate measure of guidance inhow best to use Python's great power. <i>Python in aNutshell</i> fills this need. </p><p><i>Python in a Nutshell</i>, Second Edition covers morethan the language itself; it also deals with the mostfrequently used parts of the standard library, and the most popular andimportant third party extensions. Revised and expanded forPython 2.5, this book now contains the gory details of Python's newsubprocess module and breaking news about Microsoft's newIronPython project. Our \"Nutshell\" format fits Python perfectly bypresenting the highlights of the most important modules and functionsin its standard library, which cover over 90% of your practicalprogramming needs. This book includes:</p><ul><li>A fast-paced tutorial on the syntax of the Python language</li><li>An explanation of object-oriented programming in Python </li><li>Coverage of iterators, generators, exceptions, modules,packages, strings, and regular expressions</li><li>A quick reference for Python's built-in types and functionsand key modules </li><li>Reference material on important third-party extensions,such as Numeric and Tkinter</li><li>Information about extending and embedding Python </li></ul><p><i>Python in a Nutshell</i> provides a solid,no-nonsense quick reference to information that programmers rely on themost. This book will immediately earn its place in any Pythonprogrammer's library.</p><p>Praise for the First Edition:<br/></p><p>\"In a nutshell, <i>Python in a Nutshell</i> serves oneprimary goal: to act as an immediately accessible goal for the Pythonlanguage. True, you can get most of the same core information that ispresented within the covers of this volume online, but this willinvariably be broken into multiple files, and in all likelihood lackingthe examples or the exact syntax description necessary to trulyunderstand a command.\"<br/>--Richard Cobbett, <i>Linux Format</i><br/></p><p>\"O'Reilly has several good books, of which <i>Python in aNutshell</i> by Alex Martelli is probably the best for giving yousome idea of what Python is about and how to do useful things with it.\"<br/>--Jerry Pournelle, <i>Byte Magazine</i></p></div></span>",

The mix of technologies involved and the need to use different programming languages led to a very steep learning curve for developers looking to build applications across multiple platforms.</p><p>In Building Cross-Platform GUI Applications with Fyne, you'll understand how the Go language, when paired with a modern graphical toolkit such as Fyne, can overcome these issues and make application development much easier. To provide an easy-to-use framework for cross-platform app development, the Fyne project offers many graphical concepts and design principles that are outlined throughout this book.</p><p>By working through five example projects, you'll learn how to build apps effectively, focusing on each of the main areas, including the canvas, layouts, file handling, widgets, data binding, and themes. The book will also show you how the completed applications can then be run on your desktop computer, laptop, and smartphone. After completing these projects, you will discover how to prepare applications for release and distribute them to platform marketplaces and app stores.</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll be able to create cross-platform graphical applications with visually appealing user interfaces and concise code.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Become well-versed with the history of GUI development and how Fyne and the Golang programming language make it easier</li><li>Explore how the Fyne toolkit is architected and the various modules are provided</li><li>Discover how Fyne apps can be tested and constructed using best practices</li><li>Construct five complete applications and deploy them to your devices</li><li>Customize the design of your apps by extending widgets and themes</li><li>Understand the separation and presentation of data and how to test and build applications that present dynamic data</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This Fyne-Golang GUI book is for developers from any background who are looking to build cross-platform applications with a modern toolkit. It will also be useful for Go developers who are looking to explore graphical apps and GUI developers looking for a new toolkit for cross-platform development. Basic knowledge of Graphical User Interface (GUI) development is assumed (although a brief history is also included in the book).

Python is a modular language that imports most\nuseful operations from the standard library (basic support modules;\noperating system interfaces; network protocols; file formats; data\nconversions; threads and processes; and data storage). You can't\nreally program in Python without using it. In this book, author\nFredrik Lundh, creator of the Python Imaging Library (PIL),\ndelivers tested, accurate documentation of all the modules in the\nPython Standard Library, along with over 300 annotated example\nscripts using the modules. <em>Python Standard Library</em> renders\nthis valuable information in a clean, easy-to-read format, yet\ndoesn't talk down to readers. This accurate and complete reference\ndocumentation is for the Python programmer who wants the facts and\nlittle else. The book is based on the author's work with the Python\nnewsgroup: he reviewed more than 2500 questions and answers to that\nnewsgroup in order to make sure the book covered what Python users\nreally wanted to know. An earlier version of this book has been\navailable electronically for over a year, so the material has been\ntested by Python programmers in real-life applications. This\nversion of <em>Python Standard Library</em> covers all the new\nmodules and related information for Python 2.0, the first new major\nrelease of Python in four years.\n</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><em>Programming Python</em> focuses on advanced uses of the Python\nprogramming/scripting language, which has evolved from an emerging\nlanguage of interest primarily to pioneers, to a widely accepted\ntool that traditional programmers use for real day-to-day\ndevelopment tasks. With Python, you can do almost anything you can\ndo with C++; but Python is an interpreted language designed for\nrapid application development and deployment. Among other things,\nPython supports object-oriented programming; a remarkably simple,\nreadable, and maintainable syntax; integration with C components;\nand a vast collection of pre-coded interfaces and utilities. As\nPython has grown to embrace developers on a number of different\nplatforms (Unix, Linux, Windows, Mac), companies have taken notice\nand are adopting Python for their products. It has shown up\nanimating the latest Star Wars movie, serving up maps and\ndirectories on the Internet, guiding users through Linux\ninstallations, testing chips and boards, managing Internet\ndiscussion forums, scripting online games, and even scripting\nwireless products. <em>Programming Python</em> is the most\ncomprehensive resource for advanced Python programmers available\ntoday. Reviewed and endorsed by Python creator Guido van Rossum,\nwho also provides the foreword, this book zeroes in on real-world\nPython applications. It's been updated for Python 2.0 and covers\nInternet scripting, systems programming, Tkinter GUIs, C\nintegration domains, and new Python tools and applications. Among\nthem: IDLE, JYthon, Active Scripting and COM extensions, Zope, PSP\nserver pages, restricted execution mode, the HTMLgen and SWIG code\ngenerators, thread support, CGI and Internet protocol modules. Such\napplications are the heart and soul of this second edition. Veteran\nO'Reilly author Mark Lutz has included a platform-neutral CD-ROM\nwith book examples and various Python-related packages, including\nthe full Python 2.0 source code distribution.\n</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>Discover Golang's GUI libraries such as Go-GTK (GIMP Toolkit) and Go-Qt and build beautiful, performant, and responsive graphical applications</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Conceptualize and build state-of-art GUI applications with Golang (Go)\n</li><li>Tackle the complexity of varying GUI application sizes with a structured and scalable approach\n</li><li>Get hands-on experience of GUI development with Shiny, and labs/ui, Fyne, and Walk\n</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>Go is often compared to C++ when it comes to low-level programming and implementations that require faster processing, such as Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). In fact, many claim that Go is superior to C++ in terms of its concurrency and ease of use. Most graphical application toolkits, though, are still written using C or C++, and so they don't enjoy the benefits of using a modern programming language such as Go. \n</p><p>This guide to programming GUIs with Go 1.11 explores the various toolkits available, including UI, Walk, Shiny, and Fyne. The book compares the vision behind each project to help you pick the right approach for your project. Each framework is described in detail, outlining how you can build performant applications that users will love. To aid you further in creating applications using these emerging technologies, you'll be able to easily refer to code samples and screenshots featured in the book. In addition to toolkit-specific discussions, you'll cover more complex topics, such as how to structure growing graphical applications, and how cross-platform applications can integrate with each desktop operating system to create a seamless user experience. By delving into techniques and best practices for organizing and scaling Go-based graphical applications, you'll also glimpse Go's impressive concurrency system. In the concluding chapters, you'll discover how to distribute to the main desktop marketplaces and distribution channels. \n</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll be a confident GUI developer who can use the Go language to boost the performance of your applications.\n</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Understand the benefits and complexities of building native graphical applications \n</li><li>Gain insights into how Go makes cross-platform graphical application development simple \n</li><li>Build platform-native GUI applications using andlabs/ui \n</li><li>Develop graphical Windows applications using Walk \n</li><li>Create multiplatform GUI applications using Shiny, Nuklear, and Fyne \n</li><li>Use Go wrappers for GTK and Qt for GUI application development  \n</li><li>Streamline your requirements to pick the correct toolkit strategy\n</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is designed for Go developers who are interested in building native graphical applications for desktop computers and beyond. Some knowledge of building applications using Go is useful, but not essential. Experience in developing GUIs is not required as the book explores the benefits and challenges they pose. This book will also be beneficial for GUI application developers who are interested in trying Go.</p></span>",

As Python offers a range of tools and libraries for all purposes, it has slowly evolved as the primary language for data science, including topics on: data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.</p><p>Python Data Analysis Cookbook focuses on reproducibility and creating production-ready systems. You will start with recipes that set the foundation for data analysis with libraries such as matplotlib, NumPy, and pandas. You will learn to create visualizations by choosing color maps and palettes then dive into statistical data analysis using distribution algorithms and correlations. You'll then help you find your way around different data and numerical problems, get to grips with Spark and HDFS, and then set up migration scripts for web mining.</p><p>In this book, you will dive deeper into recipes on spectral analysis, smoothing, and bootstrapping methods. Moving on, you will learn to rank stocks and check market efficiency, then work with metrics and clusters. You will achieve parallelism to improve system performance by using multiple threads and speeding up your code.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be capable of handling various data analysis techniques in Python and devising solutions for problem scenarios.</p><p><b>Style and Approach</b></p><p>The book is written in ?cookbook? style striving for high realism in data analysis. Through the recipe-based format, you can read each recipe separately as required and immediately apply the knowledge gained.</p></span>",

If you are a Python programmer who wants to code efficiently by getting the syntax and usage of a few intricate Python techniques exactly right, this book is for you.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Create a virtualenv and start a new project</li><li>Understand how and when to use the functional programming paradigm</li><li>Get familiar with the different ways the decorators can be written in</li><li>Understand the power of generators and coroutines without digressing into lambda calculus</li><li>Create metaclasses and how it makes working with Python far easier</li><li>Generate HTML documentation out of documents and code using Sphinx</li><li>Learn how to track and optimize application performance, both memory and cpu</li><li>Use the multiprocessing library, not just locally but also across multiple machines</li><li>Get a basic understanding of packaging and creating your own libraries/applications</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Python is a dynamic programming language. It is known for its high readability and hence it is often the first language learned by new programmers. Python being multi-paradigm, it can be used to achieve the same thing in different ways and it is compatible across different platforms. Even if you find writing Python code easy, writing code that is efficient, easy to maintain, and reuse is not so straightforward.</p><p>This book is an authoritative guide that will help you learn new advanced methods in a clear and contextualised way. It starts off by creating a project-specific environment using venv, introducing you to different Pythonic syntax and common pitfalls before moving on to cover the functional features in Python. It covers how to create different decorators, generators, and metaclasses. It also introduces you to functools.wraps and coroutines and how they work. Later on you will learn to use asyncio module for asynchronous clients and servers. You will also get familiar with different testing systems such as py.test, doctest, and unittest, and debugging tools such as Python debugger and faulthandler. You will learn to optimize application performance so that it works efficiently across multiple machines and Python versions. Finally, it will teach you how to access C functions with a simple Python call. By the end of the book, you will be able to write more advanced scripts and take on bigger challenges.</p><p><b>Style and Approach</b></p><p>This book is a comprehensive guide that covers advanced features of the Python language, and communicate them with an authoritative understanding of the underlying rationale for how, when, and why to use them.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

It gives beginners a simple way to start programming, but Python's standard library also provides numerous packages that allow Python-using secret agents to easily utilize very sophisticated information processing.</p><p>This book will guide new field agent trainees through putting together a Python-based toolset to gather, analyze, and communicate data. It starts by covering the basics and then moves on to sections such as file exchange, image processing, geocoding, simple trigonometry, and more sensitive statistical processing. You will then learn how to use polynomials to encode and decode data in different representations. Furthermore, this book shows you how to add tools to a Python environment, work with images, and parse HTML web pages to extract meaningful data. The idea of adding packages to Python is central to how an agent will leverage these tools for data processing.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Quickly get to grips with using Python to create tools and solve problems</li><li>Manipulate image files and learn how to encode messages into an image using steganography</li><li>Gather a file's hidden secrets, such as EXIF data and ZIP archive contents</li><li>Build applications that access, filter, and analyze live data from the Web</li><li>Design Python modules, libraries, and applications</li><li>Customize your Python environment with specialized packages</li><li>Extract data using HTTP and FTP internetworking protocols</li></ul></span>",

It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is often used as a scripting language because of its forgiving syntax and compatibility with a wide variety of different eco-systems. Its flexible syntax enables developers to write short scripts while at the same time, they can use object-oriented concepts to develop very large projects.</p><p>Python GUI Programming Cookbook follows a task-based approach to help you create beautiful and very effective GUIs with the least amount of code necessary. This book uses the simplest programming style, using the fewest lines of code to create a GUI in Python, and then advances to using object-oriented programming in later chapters. If you are new to object-oriented programming (OOP), this book will teach you how to take advantage of the OOP coding style in the context of creating GUIs written in Python.</p><p>Throughout the book, you will develop an entire GUI application, building recipe upon recipe, connecting the GUI to a database. In the later chapters, you will explore additional Python GUI frameworks, using best practices. You will also learn how to use threading to ensure your GUI doesn't go unresponsive.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be an expert in Python GUI programming to develop a common set of GUI applications.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Every recipe in this programming cookbook solves a problem you might encounter in your programming career. At the same time, most of the recipes build on each other to create an entire, real-life GUI application.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Programming is an important part of experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and Python is an ideal language for novices. It sports a very readable syntax, intuitive variable management, and a very large body of functionality that ranges from simple arithmetic to complex computing. </p><i>\n</i><p>Python for Experimental Psychologists provides researchers without prior programming experience with the knowledge they need to independently script experiments and analyses in Python. The skills it offers include: how to display stimuli on a computer screen; how to get input from peripherals (e.g. keyboard, mouse) and specialised equipment (e.g. eye trackers); how to log data; and how to control timing. In addition, it shows readers the basic principles of data analysis applied to behavioural data, and the more advanced techniques required to analyse trace data (e.g. pupil size) and gaze data.</p><p>Written informally and accessibly, the book deliberately focuses on the parts of Python that are relevant to experimental psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists. It is also supported by a companion website where you will find colour versions of the figures, along with example stimuli, datasets and scripts, and a portable Windows installation of Python.</p></span>",

You need to know who wants what and keep track of what is left to do.</p><p>This is where a ticketing system comes in.  A ticketing system allows you to check the status of various tasks: when they were requested, who requested them and why, when they were completed, and more. RT is a high-level, open source ticketing system efficiently enabling a group of people to manage tasks, issues, and requests submitted by a community of users.</p><p><i>RT Essentials</i>, co-written by one of the RT's original core developers, Jesse Vincent, starts off with a quick background lesson about ticketing systems and then shows you how to install and configure RT.  This comprehensive guide explains how to perform day-to-day tasks to turn your RT server into a highly useful tracking tool.  One way it does this is by examining how a company could use RT to manage its internal processes.  Advanced chapters focus on developing add-on tools and utilities using Perl and Mason.  There's also chapter filled with suggested uses for RT inside your organization.</p><p>No matter what kind of data your organization tracks--from sales inquiries to security incidents or anything in between--<i>RT Essentials</i> helps you use RT to provide order when you need it most.</p></div></span>",

Clearly written with practical exercises, it’s the painless way to learn how to harness the power of OOP in Python.</p><ul><li>Learn how to do Object Oriented Programming in Python using this step-by-step tutorial</li><li>Design public interfaces using abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding</li><li>Turn your designs into working software by studying the Python syntax</li><li>Raise, handle, define, and manipulate exceptions using special error objects</li><li>Implement Object Oriented Programming in Python using practical examples</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Object Oriented Programming is a very important aspect of modern programming languages. The basic principles of Object Oriented Programming are relatively easy to learn. Putting them together into working designs can be challenging.</p><p>This book makes programming more of a pleasure than a chore using powerful Python 3 object-oriented features of Python 3. It clearly demonstrates the core OOP principles and how to correctly implement OOP in Python.</p><p>Object Oriented Programming ranks high in importance among the many models Python supports. Yet, many programmers never bother learning the powerful features that make this language object oriented.</p><p>The book teaches when and how OOP should be correctly applied. It emphasizes not only the simple syntax of OOP in Python, but also how to combine these objects into well-designed software.</p><p>This book will introduce you to the terminology of the object-oriented paradigm, focusing on object-oriented design with step-by-step examples. It will take you from simple inheritance, one of the most useful tools in the object-oriented programmer's toolbox, all the way through to cooperative inheritance, one of the most complicated. You will be able to raise, handle, define, and manipulate exceptions.</p><p>You will be able to integrate the object-oriented and the not-so-object-oriented aspects of Python. You will also be able to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. You'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced to you. You'll understand the joy of unit testing and just how easy they are to create. You'll even study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and how they apply object-oriented principles.</p><p>Harness the power of Python 3 objects; it's not just a scripting language</p></span>",

Nowadays, Python is used for many scientific projects, and sometimes the calculations done in those projects require some serious fine-tuning. Profilers are tools designed to help you measure the performance of your code and help you during the optimization process, so knowing how to use them and read their output is very handy.</p><p>This book starts from the basics and progressively moves on to more advanced topics. You'll learn everything from profiling all the way up to writing a real-life application and applying a full set of tools designed to improve it in different ways. In the middle, you'll stop to learn about the major profilers used in Python and about some graphic tools to help you make sense of their output. You'll then move from generic optimization techniques onto Python-specific ones, going over the main constructs of the language that will help you improve your speed without much of a change. Finally, the book covers some number-crunching-specific libraries and how to use them properly to get the best speed out of them.</p><p>After reading this book, you will know how to take any Python code, profile it, find out where the bottlenecks are, and apply different techniques to remove them.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This easy-to-follow, practical guide will help you enhance your optimization skills by improving real-world code.</p></span>",

As Python is such a great and easy to learn language, this book is also ideal for any developer with experience of other languages and enthusiasm to expand their horizon.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Create the GUI Form and add widgets</li><li>Arrange the widgets using layout managers</li><li>Use object-oriented programming to create GUIs</li><li>Create Matplotlib charts</li><li>Use threads and talking to networks</li><li>Talk to a MySQL database via the GUI</li><li>Perform unit-testing and internationalizing the GUI</li><li>Extend the GUI with third-party graphical libraries</li><li>Get to know the best practices to create GUIs</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Python is a multi-domain, interpreted programming language. It is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It is often used as a scripting language because of its forgiving syntax and compatibility with a wide variety of different eco-systems. Python GUI Programming Cookbook follows a task-based approach to help you create beautiful and very effective GUIs with the least amount of code necessary.</p><p>This book will guide you through the very basics of creating a fully functional GUI in Python with only a few lines of code. Each and every recipe adds more widgets to the GUIs we are creating. While the cookbook recipes all stand on their own, there is a common theme running through all of them. As our GUIs keep expanding, using more and more widgets, we start to talk to networks, databases, and graphical libraries that greatly enhance our GUI’s functionality. This book is what you need to expand your knowledge on the subject of GUIs, and make sure you’re not missing out in the long run.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This programming cookbook consists of standalone recipes, and this approach makes it unique.. While each recipe explains a certain concept, throughout the book you’ll build a more and more advanced GUI, recipe after recipe. In some of the advanced topics, we simply create a new GUI in order to explore these topics in depth.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

Python is considered easy to learn, but there's no quicker way to mastery of the language than learning from an expert teacher. This edition of <i>Learning Python</i> puts you in the hands of two expert teachers, Mark Lutz and David Ascher, whose friendly, well-structured prose has guided many a programmer to proficiency with the language. <br/><br/><i>Learning Python</i>, Second Edition, offers programmers a comprehensive learning tool for Python and object-oriented programming. Thoroughly updated for the numerous language and class presentation changes that have taken place since the release of the first edition in 1999, this guide introduces the basic elements of the latest release of Python 2.3 and covers new features, such as list comprehensions, nested scopes, and iterators/generators. <br/><br/>Beyond language features, this edition of <i>Learning Python</i> also includes new context for less-experienced programmers, including fresh overviews of object-oriented programming and dynamic typing, new discussions of program launch and configuration options, new coverage of documentation sources, and more. There are also new use cases throughout to make the application of language features more concrete. <br/><br/>The first part of <i>Learning Python</i> gives programmers all the information they'll need to understand and construct programs in the Python language, including types, operators, statements, classes, functions, modules and exceptions. The authors then present more advanced material, showing how Python performs common tasks by offering real applications and the libraries available for those applications. Each chapter ends with a series of exercises that will test your Python skills and measure your understanding.<br/><br/><i>Learning Python</i>, Second Edition is a self-paced book that allows readers to focus on the core Python language in depth. As you work through the book, you'll gain a deep and complete understanding of the Python language that will help you to understand the larger application-level examples that you'll encounter on your own. If you're interested in learning Python--and want to do so quickly and efficiently--then <i>Learning Python</i>, Second Edition is your best choice.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>Python: Create-Modify-Reuse</b> is designed for all levels of Python developers interested in a practical, hands-on way of learning Python development. This book is designed to show you how to use Python (in combination with the raw processing power of your computer) to accomplish real-world tasks in a more efficient way. Don't look for an exhaustive description of the Python language--you won't find it. The book's main purpose is not to thoroughly cover the Python language, but rather to show how you can use Python to create robust, real-world applications.</p><p>In this respect, the goal is similar to foreign-language books that identify themselves as \"conversational,\" focusing on the vocabulary and concepts that people will need the most. Likewise, I focus specifically on the Python knowledge needed to accomplish practical, specific tasks. Along the way, you will learn to create useful, efficient scripts that are easy to maintain and enhance.</p><p>This book is for developers with some experience with Python who want to explore how to develop full-blown applications. It is also for developers with experience in other languages who want to learn Python by building robust applications. It is well-suited for developers who like to \"learn by doing,\" rather than exploring a language feature by feature. To get the most out of the book, you should understand basic programming principles.</p><p>Because this book is project-based, you can approach it in numerous ways. You can, of course, read it from cover to cover. Chapters 2 through 8 each cover a different project, so the chapters are independent of each other. However, because each chapter project is covered individually, there may be some overlap of information. I also sometimes refer to explanations of particular topics covered in previous chapters. This will help to reinforce important concepts.</p><p>The end of the book contains two appendixes. The first one is a listing of Python resources you can check out for more information. The second one will help you with installing additional components used in some of the examples.</p><p>This book starts with a basic overview of the Python language, designed for those familiar with other languages but new to Python. It is followed by several chapters, each of which describes a complete project that can be used as-is or modified and extended to suit your particular purposes. You'll find applications that access databases, take advantage of web technologies, and facilitate network communications, to name a few. In addition, and more important than the technologies you will be introduced to, you will learn how to use Python to solve real challenges. Following these chapters are two chapters that cover accessing operating system resources and debugging and testing, respectively.</p><p>Each project chapter contains complete instructions describing how to install and use the application, so you can actually see the program run as you learn how to construct and use it, including how the project was designed and prototyped. This book is intended to be both a reference guide and a learning aid, teaching you how to build solutions with Python and providing reference information on a wide variety of Python programming concepts.</p><p>It is hoped that this book will help you have fun with Python and build useful applications, and—unlike my experience with building a deck—without sore thumbs.</p><p>This book is framed around the code itself. This is because developers are typically looking for how to do something; and, as with many activities, you learn how to do something by watching how others do and trying it yourself. If you want to know how a <code>for</code> loop works, you'll find <code>for</code> loops in my code, but that's not the thrust of the book. Instead, this book shows you how to do things: how to build a content management system, how to build a test management system, how to set up a system for tracking customer follow-up, and so on. Along the way, you'll learn how to communicate with a SQL database, how to act as a web server or communicate with one, how to access operating system services, and more.</p><p>There are three basic components to the book:</p><ul><li><p>Chapter 1 is a brief overview of the Python language.</p></li><li><p>Chapters 2–8 cover seven different programming projects, which illustrate various technologies and techniques available to Python developers.</p></li><li><p>Chapters 9–10 cover additional, advanced topics, which will help you as you build Python projects.</p></li></ul><p>The project chapters have a consistent structure:</p><ul><li><p>Overview: What does the application do?</p></li><li><p>Using the program</p></li><li><p>Design</p></li><li><p>How it all fits together</p></li><li><p>Modules involved</p></li><li><p>Code and code explanation</p></li><li><p>Module/class 1 explanation</p></li><li><p>Module/class 2 explanation</p></li><li><p>Minor code file explanation</p></li><li><p>Testing, including suggested tests</p></li><li><p>Modifying the project, including some suggested adaptations</p></li><li><p>Summary</p></li></ul><p>Each project is designed with classes that can be reused and accessed for multiple purposes. This is one of the main benefits of object-oriented programming, so designing for reusability is a main focus of the book. The book contains the following chapters:</p><ol><li><p>Python Basics</p><p>This chapter is a basic primer on the Python language, and it functions as either a quick tutorial for experienced programmers new to Python or a refresher for programmers with Python experience.</p><p>Part I: The Projects</p></li><li><p>Directory/File Snapshot Program</p><p>This project demonstrates how to interact with files, create and manipulate data structures, and provide user output. It also touches on code design issues to improve code maintainability. Often when installing or uninstalling software, or verifying changes to a file system, it can be valuable to take a \"snapshot\" of the files and directories, along with their size and last-modified time. The script introduced in this chapter does just that. This chapter also explores how to capture a directory listing into a Python list, and explains how to query this list for particular values.</p></li><li><p>DVD Inventory System</p><p>This project takes advantage of Python's capability to access and manipulate data in a SQL database. The application enables multiple users to log in to a website that provides access to a DVD inventory database. Permissions are set such that some users can add, modify, or delete entries, whereas other users have read-only access to the data.</p></li><li><p>Web Performance Tester</p><p>This project shows how to communicate with a Python web server and retrieve information regarding how long it takes to receive requested items from the web server. Although writing Python programs to work on a single computer can be useful, the real power of Python can be seen when it is used to script communication between computers on a network. Most networks contain several web servers. A nice feature of Python is that it can act as a lightweight server for various Internet protocols, such as HTTP (web) and ftp. This application enables you to monitor performance of HTTP traffic on your network.</p></li><li><p>Customer Follow-Up System</p><p>This project shows how to present a web form to the user and retrieve data from it, how to automatically format and send e-mail through an SMTP server, and how to generate an HTML-formatted report. The task for the second example is to automatically generate a customer comments e-mail message based on information the customer enters in a form. It uses the <code>mod_python</code> Apache module to take the information entered in the HTTP form and then utilizes a Python script on the web server to send that information to an SMTP server for mail delivery.</p></li><li><p>Test Management/Reporting System</p><p>This project makes use of the <code>unittest</code> module to run tests against an existing application, and creates a framework for reporting test results. Testing is a vital process for developing software. This application enables users to run tests for a given piece of software, to list the previous test runs by date, to show test run results for any previously run tests, and to output the results of any test run as HTML for viewing in a web browser.</p></li><li><p>Version Management System</p><p>This project connects to a list of servers via telnet, checks the application version of a pre-set application list, and displays its results both as output and to a log file. Often, a system administrator needs to patch systems or ensure that systems have the latest application versions installed. This script is an easy way to accomplish that task. It makes use of Python's capability to emulate a telnet client and log in to remote systems and perform functions on that remote system.</p></li><li><p>Content Management System</p><p>This project explores Plone, a popular content management system based on Python and Zope (a Python-based application server). Because Python is a very mature language, numerous applications have been built on top of it. A great thing about working with Python-based applications is that you get the benefit of a full-blown application but you can still use Python to configure and customize it.</p><p>Part II: Advanced Topics</p></li><li><p>Interacting with the Operating System</p><p>When writing scripts \"in the real world,\" often it is critical to be able to access services available through (and particular to) the operating system you happen to be on. For example, suppose you wanted to read or modify the Window Registry? Or you wanted to get the Linux process ID of a particular process that is running? Is such a thing even possible? Definitely—and this chapter shows you how.</p></li><li><p>Debugging and Testing</p><p>Because I am a software tester myself, testing is a subject that is certainly close to my heart. In...</p></li></ol></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The equations used to describe dynamic properties of physical systems are often nonlinear, and it is rarely possible to find their solutions. Although numerical solutions are impractical and graphical techniques are not useful for many types of systems, there are different theorems and methods that are useful regarding qualitative properties of nonlinear systems and their solutions—system stability being the most crucial property. Without stability, a system will not have value.<br/><br/><strong>Nonlinear Systems Stability Analysis: Lyapunov-Based Approach</strong><b> </b>introduces advanced tools for stability analysis of nonlinear systems. It presents the most recent progress in stability analysis and provides a complete review of the dynamic systems stability analysis methods using Lyapunov approaches. The author discusses standard stability techniques, highlighting their shortcomings, and also describes recent developments in stability analysis that can improve applicability of the standard methods. The text covers mostly new topics such as stability of homogonous nonlinear systems and higher order Lyapunov functions derivatives for stability analysis. It also addresses special classes of nonlinear systems including time-delayed and fuzzy systems.<br/><br/>Presenting new methods, this book provides a nearly complete set of methods for constructing Lyapunov functions in both autonomous and nonautonomous systems, touching on new topics that open up novel research possibilities. Gathering a body of research into one volume, this text offers information to help engineers design stable systems using practice-oriented methods and can be used for graduate courses in a range of engineering disciplines.</p></span>",

Several frameworks have emerged in the last few\nyears that share ideas with Ruby on Rails and leverage the\nexpressive nature of Python. This Short Cut will tell you what you\nneed to know about the hottest fullstack frameworks: Django,\nPylons, and TurboGears. Their philosophies, relative strengths, and\ndevelopment status are described in detail.\n</p><p>What you won't find out is, \"Which one should I use?\" The short\nanswer is that all of them can be used to build web applications-\nthe challenge for the reader is to find the one that fits his or\nher project or coding style best.</p></span></span></span>",
