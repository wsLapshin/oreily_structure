His tour is remarkably comprehensive.

In <i><b>C++ Templates, Second Edition,</b></i> three pioneering C++ experts show why, when, and how to use modern templates to build software that’s cleaner, faster, more efficient, and easier to maintain.</p><p>Now extensively updated for the C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards, this new edition presents state-of-the-art techniques for a wider spectrum of applications. The authors provide authoritative explanations of all new language features that either improve templates or interact with them, including variadic templates, generic lambdas, class template argument deduction, compile-time if, forwarding references, and user-defined literals. They also deeply delve into fundamental language concepts (like value categories) and fully cover all standard type traits.</p><p>The book starts with an insightful tutorial on basic concepts and relevant language features. The remainder of the book serves as a comprehensive reference, focusing first on language details and then on coding techniques, advanced applications, and sophisticated idioms. Throughout, examples clearly illustrate abstract concepts and demonstrate best practices for exploiting all that C++ templates can do.</p><ul><li>Understand exactly how templates behave, and avoid common pitfalls</li><li>Use templates to write more efficient, flexible, and maintainable software</li><li>Master today’s most effective idioms and techniques</li><li>Reuse source code without compromising performance or safety</li><li>Benefit from utilities for generic programming in the C++ Standard Library</li><li>Preview the upcoming <i>concepts</i> feature</li></ul><p><i>The companion website, <a href=\"http://tmplbook.com\" target=\"_blank\">tmplbook.com</a>, contains sample code and additional updates.</i></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>Become a better programmer with performance improvement techniques such as concurrency, lock-free programming, atomic operations, parallelism, and memory management</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Learn proven techniques from a heavyweight and recognized expert in C++ and high-performance computing</li><li>Understand the limitations of modern CPUs and their performance impact</li><li>Find out how you can avoid writing inefficient code and get the best optimizations from the compiler</li><li>Learn the tradeoffs and costs of writing high-performance programs</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>The great free lunch of \"performance taking care of itself\" is over. Until recently, programs got faster by themselves as CPUs were upgraded, but that doesn't happen anymore. The clock frequency of new processors has almost peaked, and while new architectures provide small improvements to existing programs,  this only helps slightly. To write efficient software, you now have to know how to program by making good use of the available computing resources, and this book will teach you how to do that.</p><p>The Art of Efficient Programming covers all the major aspects of writing efficient programs, such as using CPU resources and memory efficiently, avoiding unnecessary computations, measuring performance, and how to put concurrency and multithreading to good use. You'll also learn about compiler optimizations and how to use the programming language (C++) more efficiently. Finally, you'll understand how design decisions impact performance.</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll not only have enough knowledge of processors and compilers to write efficient programs, but you'll also be able to understand which techniques to use and what to measure while improving performance. At its core, this book is about learning how to learn.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Discover how to use the hardware computing resources in your programs effectively</li><li>Understand the relationship between memory order and memory barriers</li><li>Familiarize yourself with the performance implications of different data structures and organizations</li><li>Assess the performance impact of concurrent memory accessed and how to minimize it</li><li>Discover when to use and when not to use lock-free programming techniques</li><li>Explore different ways to improve the effectiveness of compiler optimizations</li><li>Design APIs for concurrent data structures and high-performance data structures to avoid inefficiencies</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for experienced developers and programmers who work on performance-critical projects and want to learn new techniques to improve the performance of their code. Programmers in algorithmic trading, gaming, bioinformatics, computational genomics, or computational fluid dynamics communities will get the most out of the examples in this book, but the techniques are fairly universal. Although this book uses the C++ language, the concepts demonstrated in the book can be easily transferred or applied to other compiled languages such as C, Java, Rust, Go, and more.</p></span>",

The authors use examples derived from real code bases to illustrate every finding objectively and to illuminate key issues. Each feature identifies the sound use cases, hidden pitfalls, and shortcomings of that language feature.

Most of his code examples are written for C++17, with added coverage of newer versions and C++20 wherever appropriate, and references to the official C++ Core Guidelines online.</p><p>Whether you’re creating new software or improving legacy code, Grimm will help you get more value from the Core Guidelines’ most useful rules, as you write code that’s safer, clearer, more efficient, and easier to maintain.</p><ul><li><p>Apply the guidelines and underlying programming philosophy</p></li><li><p>Correctly use interfaces, functions, classes, enum, resources, expressions, and statements</p></li><li><p>Optimize performance, implement concurrency and parallelism, and handle errors</p></li><li><p>Work effectively with constants, immutability, templates, generics, and metaprogramming</p></li><li><p>Improve your C++ style, manage source files, and use the Standard Library</p></li></ul><p><em>Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

This book, updated for the recently released C++20 standard, is a must for every developer, software architect, or team leader who is interested in well-crafted C++ code, and thus also wants to save development costs. If you want to teach yourself about writing better C++ code, <i>Clean C++20</i> is exactly what you need. It is written for C++ developers of all skill levels and shows by example how to write understandable, flexible, maintainable, and efficient C++ code. Even if you are a seasoned C++ developer, there are nuggets and data points in this book that you will find useful in your work.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you don't take care with your codebase, you can produce a large, messy, and unmaintainable beast in any programming language. However, C++ projects in particular are prone to get messy and tend to slip into a maintenance nightmare. There is lots of C++ code out there that looks as if it was written in the 1980s, completely ignoring principles and practices of well-written and modern C++.</div><div><br/></div><div>It seems that C++ developers have been forgotten by those who preach Software Craftsmanship and Clean Code principles. The web is full of C++ code examples that may be very fast and highly optimized, but whose developers have completely ignored elementary principles of good design and well-written code. This book will explain how to avoid this and how to get the most out of your C++ code.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a modern software development practice that can dramatically reduce the number of defects in systems, produce more maintainable code, and give you the confidence to change your software to meet changing needs. But C++ programmers have been ignored by those promoting TDD--until now. In this book, Jeff Langr gives you hands-on lessons in the challenges and rewards of doing TDD in C++.</p><p><i>Modern C++ Programming With Test-Driven Development</i>, the only comprehensive treatment on TDD in C++ provides you with everything you need to know about TDD, and the challenges and benefits of implementing it in your C++ systems. Its many detailed code examples take you step-by-step from TDD basics to advanced concepts. As a veteran C++ programmer, you're already writing high-quality code, and you work hard to maintain code quality. It doesn't have to be that hard.</p><p>In this book, you'll learn:</p><ul><li>how to use TDD to improve legacy C++ systems</li><li>how to identify and deal with troublesome system dependencies</li><li>how to do dependency injection, which is particularly tricky in C++</li><li>how to use testing tools for C++ that aid TDD</li><li>new C++11 features that facilitate TDD</li></ul><p>As you grow in TDD mastery, you'll discover how to keep a massive C++ system from becoming a design mess over time, as well as particular C++ trouble spots to avoid. You'll find out how to prevent your tests from being a maintenance burden and how to think in TDD without giving up your hard-won C++ skills. Finally, you'll see how to grow and sustain TDD in your team.</p><p>Whether you're a complete unit-testing novice or an experienced tester, this book will lead you to mastery of test-driven development in C++.</p><p><b>What You Need</b></p><ul><li>A C++ compiler running under Windows or Linux, preferably one that supports C++11. Examples presented in the book were built under gcc 4.7.2.</li><li>Google Mock 1.6 (downloadable for free; it contains Google Test as well) or an alternate C++ unit testing tool. Most examples in the book are written for Google Mock, but it isn't difficult to translate them to your tool of choice.</li><li>A good programmer's editor or IDE.</li><li>cmake, preferably. Of course, you can use your own preferred make too. CMakeLists.txt files are provided for each project. Examples provided were built using cmake version 2.8.9.</li><li>Various freely-available third-party libraries are used as the basis for examples in the book. These include:</li></ul><ul><li>cURL</li><li>JsonCpp</li><li>Boost (filesystem, date_time/gregorian, algorithm, assign)</li></ul><p>Several examples use the boost headers/libraries. Only one example uses cURL and JsonCpp.</p></div></span>",

The library, however, is not self-explanatory. To make full use of its components–and to benefit from their power–you need a resource that does far more than list the classes and their functions.</p><p><strong><em>The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition,</em></strong> describes this library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11). The book provides comprehensive documentation of each library component, including an introduction to its purpose and design; clearly written explanations of complex concepts; the practical programming details needed for effective use; traps and pitfalls; the exact signature and definition of the most important classes and functions; and numerous examples of working code. The book focuses in particular on the Standard Template Library (STL), examining containers, iterators, function objects, and STL algorithms.</p><p>The book covers all the new C++11 library components, including</p><ul><li><p>Concurrency</p></li><li><p>Fractional arithmetic</p></li><li><p>Clocks and timers</p></li><li><p>Tuples</p></li><li><p>New STL containers</p></li><li><p>New STL algorithms</p></li><li><p>New smart pointers</p></li><li><p>New locale facets</p></li><li><p>Random numbers and distributions</p></li><li><p>Type traits and utilities</p></li><li><p>Regular expressions</p></li></ul><p>The book also examines the new C++ programming style and its effect on the standard library, including lambdas, range-based for loops, move semantics, and variadic templates.</p><p>An accompanying Web site, including source code, can be found at <a href=\"http://www.cppstdlib.com\">www.cppstdlib.com</a>.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>Modern C++ Design</b><em>is an important book. Fundamentally,\nit demonstrates ‘generic patterns’ or ‘pattern\ntemplates’ as a powerful new way of creating extensible\ndesigns in C++–a new way to combine templates and patterns\nthat you may never have dreamt was possible, but is. If your work\ninvolves C++ design and coding, you should read this book. Highly\nrecommended.</em><br/>\n–Herb Sutter</p><p><em>What’s left to say about C++ that hasn’t already\nbeen said? Plenty, it turns out.</em><br/>\n–From the Foreword by John Vlissides</p><p>In <b><em>Modern C++ Design</em></b><em>,</em> Andrei Alexandrescu\nopens new vistas for C++ programmers. Displaying extraordinary\ncreativity and programming virtuosity, Alexandrescu offers a\ncutting-edge approach to design that unites design patterns,\ngeneric programming, and C++, enabling programmers to achieve\nexpressive, flexible, and highly reusable code.</p><p>This book introduces the concept of generic\ncomponents–reusable design templates that produce boilerplate\ncode for compiler consumption–all within C++. Generic\ncomponents enable an easier and more seamless transition from\ndesign to application code, generate code that better expresses the\noriginal design intention, and support the reuse of design\nstructures with minimal recoding.</p><p>The author describes the specific C++ techniques and features\nthat are used in building generic components and goes on to\nimplement industrial strength generic components for real-world\napplications. Recurring issues that C++ developers face in their\nday-to-day activity are discussed in depth and implemented in a\ngeneric way. These include:</p><li><p>Policy-based design for flexibility</p></li><li><p>Partial template specialization</p></li><li><p>Typelists–powerful type manipulation structures</p></li><li><p>Patterns such as Visitor, Singleton, Command, and\nFactories</p></li><li><p>Multi-method engines</p></li><p>For each generic component, the book presents the fundamental\nproblems and design options, and finally implements a generic\nsolution.</p><p>In addition, an accompanying Web site,\n<em>http://www.awl.com/cseng/titles/0-201-70431-5</em>, makes the\ncode implementations available for the generic components in the\nbook and provides a free, downloadable C++ library, called Loki,\ncreated by the author. Loki provides out-of-the-box functionality\nfor virtually any C++ project.</p><p>Get a value-added service!

			"description": "<span><div><p>Writing reliable and maintainable C++ software is hard. Designing such software at scale adds a new set of challenges. Creating large-scale systems requires a practical understanding of logical design — beyond the theoretical concepts addressed in most popular texts. To be successful on an enterprise scale, developers must also address physical design, a dimension of software engineering that may be unfamiliar even to expert developers. Drawing on over 30 years of hands-on experience building massive, mission-critical enterprise systems, John Lakos shows how to create and grow Software Capital. This groundbreaking volume lays the foundation for projects of all sizes and demonstrates the processes, methods, techniques, and tools needed for successful real-world, large-scale development.</p><p>Up to date and with a solid engineering focus, <i><b>Large-Scale C++, Volume I: Process and Architecture,</b></i> demonstrates fundamental design concepts with concrete examples. Professional developers of all experience levels will gain insights that transform their approach to design and development by understanding how to</p><ul><li><p>Raise productivity by leveraging differences between infrastructure and application development</p></li><li><p>Achieve exponential productivity gains through feedback and hierarchical reuse</p></li><li><p>Embrace the component’s role as the fundamental unit of both logical and physical design</p></li><li><p>Analyze how fundamental properties of compiling and linking affect component design</p></li><li><p>Discover effective partitioning of logical content in appropriately sized physical aggregates</p></li><li><p>Internalize the important differences among sufficient, complete, minimal, and primitive software</p></li><li><p>Deliver solutions that simultaneously optimize encapsulation, stability, and performance</p></li><li><p>Exploit the nine established levelization techniques to avoid cyclic physical dependencies</p></li><li><p>Use lateral designs judiciously to avoid the “heaviness” of conventional layered architectures</p></li><li><p>Employ appropriate architectural insulation techniques for eliminating compile-time coupling</p></li><li><p>Master the multidimensional process of designing large systems using component-based methods</p></li></ul><p>This is the first of John Lakos’s three authoritative volumes on developing large-scale systems using C++. This book, written for fellow software practitioners, uses familiar C++ constructs to solve real-world problems while identifying (and motivating) modern C++ alternatives. Together with the forthcoming <i>Volume II: Design and Implementation</i> and <i>Volume III: Verification and Testing</i>, <i><b>Large-Scale C++</b></i> offers comprehensive guidance for all aspects of large-scale C++ software development. If you are an architect or project leader, this book will empower you to solve critically important problems right now — and serve as your go-to reference for years to come.</p><p><i>Register your book for convenient access to downloads, updates, and/or corrections as they become available.

			"description": "<span><i>API Design for C++</i> provides a comprehensive discussion of Application Programming Interface (API) development, from initial design through implementation, testing, documentation, release, versioning, maintenance, and deprecation. It is the only book that teaches the strategies of C++ API development, including interface design, versioning, scripting, and plug-in extensibility. Drawing from the author's experience on large scale, collaborative software projects, the text offers practical techniques of API design that produce robust code for the long term. It presents patterns and practices that provide real value to individual developers as well as organizations. <br/><br/><i>API Design for C++</i> explores often overlooked issues, both technical and non-technical, contributing to successful design decisions that product high quality, robust, and long-lived APIs. It focuses on various API styles and patterns that will allow you to produce elegant and durable libraries. A discussion on testing strategies concentrates on automated API testing techniques rather than attempting to include end-user application testing techniques such as GUI testing, system testing, or manual testing. Each concept is illustrated with extensive C++ code examples, and fully functional examples and working source code for experimentation are available online. <br/><br/>This book will be helpful to new programmers who understand the fundamentals of C++ and who want to advance their design skills, as well as to senior engineers and software architects seeking to gain new expertise to complement their existing talents. Three specific groups of readers are targeted: practicing software engineers and architects, technical managers, and students and educators.<ul><li>The only book that teaches the strategies of C++ API development, including design, versioning, documentation, testing, scripting, and extensibility</li><li>Extensive code examples illustrate each concept, with fully functional examples and working source code for experimentation available online</li><li>Covers various API styles and patterns with a focus on practical and efficient designs for large-scale long-term projects</li></ul>\n</span>",

Add <em>Effective STL</em> to that\nlist.”<br/>\n– Thomas Becker, Senior Software Engineer, Zephyr Associates,\nInc., and columnist, <em>C/C++ Users Journal</em>\n</p><p>C++’s Standard Template Library is\nrevolutionary, but learning to use it well has always been a\nchallenge. Until now. In this book, best-selling author Scott\nMeyers (<em>Effective\nC++</em>, and <em>More Effective\nC++</em>) reveals the critical rules of thumb employed by the\nexperts – the things they almost always do or almost always\navoid doing – to get the most out of the library.</p><p>Other books describe <em>what’s in</em>\nthe STL. <em>Effective STL</em> shows you <em>how to use it</em>. Each\nof the book’s 50 guidelines is backed by Meyers’\nlegendary analysis and incisive examples, so you’ll learn not\nonly what to do, but also <em>when</em> to do it – and\n<em>why</em>.</p><p>Highlights of <em>Effective STL</em>\ninclude:</p><li><p>Advice on choosing among standard STL containers (like vector\nand list), nonstandard STL containers (like hash_set and hash_map),\nand non-STL containers (like bitset).</p></li><li><p>Techniques to maximize the efficiency of the STL and the\nprograms that use it.</p></li><li><p>Insights into the behavior of iterators, function objects, and\nallocators, including things you should <em>not</em> do.</p></li><li><p>Guidance for the proper use of algorithms and member functions\nwhose names are the same (e.g., find), but whose actions differ in\nsubtle (but important) ways.</p></li><li><p>Discussions of potential portability problems, including\nstraightforward ways to avoid them.</p></li><p>Like Meyers’ previous books,\n<em>Effective STL</em> is filled with proven wisdom that comes only\nfrom experience. Its clear, concise, penetrating style makes it an\nessential resource for every STL programmer.</p></span></span>",

Woehr, Dr. Dobbs Journal, June 03, 2005<br/><br/></b></p><p>\"If you're like me, you're excited by what\npeople do with template metaprogramming (TMP) but are frustrated at\nthe lack of clear guidance and powerful tools. Well, this is the\nbook we've been waiting for. With help from the excellent Boost\nMetaprogramming Library, David and Aleksey take TMP from the\nlaboratory to the workplace with readable prose and practical\nexamples, showing that \"compile-time STL\" is as able as its runtime\ncounterpart. Serving as a tutorial as well as a handbook for\nexperts, this is the book on C++ template metaprogramming.\"<br/>\n—Chuck Allison, Editor, <em>The C++ Source</em></p><p><b><em>C++ Template Metaprogramming</em></b>\nsheds light on the most powerful idioms of today's C++, at long\nlast delivering practical metaprogramming tools and techniques into\nthe hands of the everyday programmer.</p><p>A metaprogram is a program that generates\nor manipulates program code. Ever since generic programming was\nintroduced to C++, programmers have discovered myriad \"template\ntricks\" for manipulating programs as they are compiled, effectively\neliminating the barrier between program and metaprogram. While\nexcitement among C++ experts about these capabilities has reached\nthe community at large, their practical application remains out of\nreach for most programmers. This book explains what metaprogramming\nis and how it is best used. It provides the foundation you'll need\nto use the template metaprogramming effectively in your own\nwork.</p><p>This book is aimed at any programmer who is\ncomfortable with idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL). C++\npower-users will gain a new insight into their existing work and a\nnew fluency in the domain of metaprogramming. Intermediate-level\nprogrammers who have learned a few advanced template techniques\nwill see where these tricks fit in the big picture and will gain\nthe conceptual foundation to use them with discipline. Programmers\nwho have caught the scent of metaprogramming, but for whom it is\nstill mysterious, will finally gain a clear understanding of how,\nwhen, and why it works. All readers will leave with a new tool of\nunprecedented power at their disposal—the Boost\nMetaprogramming Library.</p><p>The companion CD-ROM contains all Boost C++\nlibraries, including the Boost Metaprogramming Library and its\nreference documentation, along with all of the book's sample code\nand extensive supplementary material.</p><br/></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The C++11 standard allows programmers to express ideas more clearly, simply, and directly, and to write faster, more efficient code. Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer and original implementer of C++, thoroughly covers the details of this language and its use in his definitive reference, <em>The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition</em>.</p><p>In <strong><em>A Tour of C++</em></strong>, Stroustrup excerpts the overview chapters from that complete reference, expanding and enhancing them to give an experienced programmer–in just a few hours–a clear idea of what constitutes modern C++. In this concise, self-contained guide, Stroustrup covers most major language features and the major standard-library components–not, of course, in great depth, but to a level that gives programmers a meaningful overview of the language, some key examples, and practical help in getting started.</p><p>Stroustrup presents the C++ features in the context of the programming styles they support, such as object-oriented and generic programming. His tour is remarkably comprehensive. Coverage begins with the basics, then ranges widely through more advanced topics, including many that are new in C++11, such as move semantics, uniform initialization, lambda expressions, improved containers, random numbers, and concurrency. The tour ends with a discussion of the design and evolution of C++ and the extensions added for C++11.</p><p>This guide does not aim to teach you how to program (see Stroustrup's <em>Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ </em>for that); nor will it be the only resource you'll need for C++ mastery (see Stroustrup's <em>The C++ Programming Language, Fourth Edition</em>, for that). If, however, you are a C or C++ programmer wanting greater familiarity with the current C++ language, or a programmer versed in another language wishing to gain an accurate picture of the nature and benefits of modern C++, you can't find a shorter or simpler introduction than this tour provides.</p></span>",

The In a Nutshell books have earned a solid reputation in the field as the well-thumbed references that sit beside the knowledgeable developer's keyboard. <i>C++ in a Nutshell</i> lives up to the In a Nutshell promise. <i>C++ in a Nutshell</i> is a lean, focused reference that offers practical examples for the most important, most often used, aspects of C++.<i>C++ in a Nutshell</i> packs an enormous amount of information on C++ (and the many libraries used with it) in an indispensable quick reference for those who live in a deadline-driven world and need the facts but not the frills.The book's language reference is organized first by topic, followed by an alphabetical reference to the language's keywords, complete with syntax summaries and pointers to the topic references. The library reference is organized by header file, and each library chapter and class declaration presents the classes and types in alphabetical order, for easy lookup. Cross-references link related methods, classes, and other key features. This is an ideal resource for students as well as professional programmers.When you're programming, you need answers to questions about language syntax or parameters required by library routines quickly. What, for example, is the C++ syntax to define an alias for a namespace? Just how do you create and use an iterator to work with the contents of a standard library container? <i>C++ in a Nutshell</i> is a concise desktop reference that answers these questions, putting the full power of this flexible, adaptable (but somewhat difficult to master) language at every C++ programmer's fingertips.</p></span>",

Drawing on years of experience, Meyers explains how to\nwrite software that is <em>more effective</em>: more efficient, more\nrobust, more consistent, more portable, and more reusable. In\nshort, how to write C++ software that’s just plain\nbetter.</p><p><em>More Effective C++</em> includes:</p><li><p>Proven methods for improving program efficiency, including\nincisive examinations of the time/space costs of C++ language\nfeatures<br/></p></li><li><p>Comprehensive descriptions of advanced techniques used by C++\nexperts, including placement new, virtual constructors, smart\npointers, reference counting, proxy classes, and\ndouble-dispatching<br/></p></li><li><p>Examples of the profound impact of exception handling on the\nstructure and behavior of C++ classes and functions<br/></p></li><li><p>Practical treatments of new language features, including bool,\nmutable, explicit, namespaces, member templates, the Standard\nTemplate Library, and more. If your compilers don’t yet\nsupport these features, Meyers shows you how to get the job done\nwithout them.</p></li><p><em>More Effective C++</em> is filled with\npragmatic, down-to-earth advice you’ll use every day. Like\n<em>Effective C++</em> before it, <em>More Effective C++</em> is\nessential reading for anyone working with C++.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Discover everything you need to know about C++ in a logical progression of small lessons that you can work through as quickly or as slowly as you need. This book divides C++ up into bite-sized chunks that will help you learn the language one step at a time. Fully updated to include C++20, it assumes no familiarity with C++ or any other C-based language. </p><p><i>Exploring C++20</i><i> </i>acknowledges that C++ can be a complicated language, so rather than baffle you with complex chapters explaining functions, classes, and statements in isolation you’ll focus on how to achieve results. By learning a little bit of this and a little of that you’ll soon have amassed enough knowledge to be writing non-trivial programs and will have built a solid foundation of experience that puts those previously baffling concepts into context.</p><p>In this fully-revised third edition of <i>Exploring C++</i>, you’ll learn how to use the standard library early in the book. Next, you’ll work with operators, objects, and data-sources in increasingly realistic situations. Finally, you’ll start putting the pieces together to create sophisticated programs of your own design confident that you’ve built a firm base of experience from which to grow.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Grasp the basics, including compound statements, modules, and more</li>  Work with custom types and see how to use them   <li>Write useful algorithms, functions, and more</li><li>Discover the latest C++ 20 features, including concepts, modules, and ranges<br/></li> <li>Apply your skills to projects that include a fixed-point numbers and      body-mass index applications</li>  Carry out generic programming and apply it in a practical project  <li>Exploit multiple inheritance, traits/policies, overloaded      functions, and metaprogramming</li> </ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>Experienced programmers who may have little or no experience with C++ who want an accelerated learning guide to C++20 so they can hit the ground running.  <p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p></p></span>",

Do you relish writing robust and\nextensible code? Then take a few minutes and challenge yourself\nwith some tough C++ design and programming problems.</p><p>The puzzles and problems in <b><em>Exceptional C++</em></b> not\nonly entertain, they will help you hone your skills to become the\nsharpest C++ programmer you can be. Many of these problems are\nculled from the famous <em>Guru of the Week</em> feature of the\nInternet newsgroup comp.lang.c++.moderated, expanded and updated to\nconform to the official ISO/ANSI C++ Standard.</p><p>Each problem is rated according to difficulty and is designed to\nillustrate subtle programming mistakes or design considerations.\nAfter you've had a chance to attempt a solution yourself, the book\nthen dissects the code, illustrates what went wrong, and shows how\nthe problem can be fixed. Covering a broad range of C++ topics, the\nproblems and solutions address critical issues such as:</p><li><p>Generic programming and how to write reusable templates</p></li><li><p>Exception safety issues and techniques</p></li><li><p>Robust class design and inheritance</p></li><li><p>Compiler firewalls and the Pimpl Idiom</p></li><li><p>Name lookup, namespaces, and the Interface Principle</p></li><li><p>Memory management issues and techniques</p></li><li><p>Traps, pitfalls, and anti-idioms</p></li><li><p>Optimization</p></li><p>Try your skills against the C++ masters and come away with the\ninsight and experience to create more efficient, effective, robust,\nand portable C++ code.</p><p><br/><br/>\n0201615622B04062001</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>As scientific and engineering projects grow larger and more complex, it is increasingly likely that those projects will be written in C++. With embedded hardware growing more powerful, much of its software is moving to C++, too. Mastering C++ gives you strong skills for programming at nearly every level, from “close to the hardware” to the highest-level abstractions. In short, C++ is a language that scientific and technical practitioners need to know.</p><p>Peter Gottschling’s <b><i>Discovering Modern C++</i></b> is an intensive introduction that guides you smoothly to sophisticated approaches based on advanced features. Gottschling introduces key concepts using examples from many technical problem domains, drawing on his extensive experience training professionals and teaching C++ to students of physics, math, and engineering.</p><p>This book is designed to help you get started rapidly and then master increasingly robust features, from lambdas to expression templates. You’ll also learn how to take advantage of the powerful libraries available to C++ programmers: both the Standard Template Library (STL) and scientific libraries for arithmetic, linear algebra, differential equations, and graphs.</p><p>Throughout, Gottschling demonstrates how to write clear and expressive software using object orientation, generics, metaprogramming, and procedural techniques. By the time you’re finished, you’ll have mastered all the abstractions you need to write C++ programs with exceptional quality and performance.</p></span>",

Duffy's 2004 edition of <i>Financial Instrument Pricing Using C++</i>. Both C++ and computational finance have evolved and changed dramatically in the last ten years and this book documents these improvements. Duffy focuses on these developments and the advantages for the quant developer by:</p><ul><li>Delving into a detailed account of the new C++11 standard and its applicability to computational finance.</li><li>Using de-facto standard libraries, such as <i>Boost</i> and <i>Eigen</i> to improve developer productivity.</li><li>Developing multiparadigm software using the object-oriented, generic, and functional programming styles.</li><li>Designing flexible numerical algorithms: modern numerical methods and multiparadigm design patterns.</li><li>Providing a detailed explanation of the Finite Difference Methods through six chapters, including new developments such as ADE, Method of Lines (MOL), and Uncertain Volatility Models.</li><li>Developing applications, from financial model to algorithmic design and code, through a coherent approach.</li><li>Generating interoperability with Excel add-ins, C#, and C++/CLI.</li><li>Using random number generation in C++11 and Monte Carlo simulation.</li></ul><p>Duffy adopted a spiral model approach while writing each chapter of <i>Financial Instrument Pricing Using C++ 2e</i>: analyse a little, design a little, and code a little. Each cycle ends with a working prototype in C++ and shows how a given algorithm or numerical method works. Additionally, each chapter contains non-trivial exercises and projects that discuss improvements and extensions to the material.</p><p>This book is for designers and application developers in computational finance, and assumes the reader has some fundamental experience of C++ and derivatives pricing.<br/><br/></p><p><b>HOW TO RECEIVE THE SOURCE CODE</b></p><p><b>Once you have purchased a copy of the book please send an email to the author dduffyATdatasim.nl requesting your personal and non-transferable copy of the source code.

The book deals with language aspects, design patterns, examples and applications (seen as case studies). Special emphasis is put on small reusable techniques that will improve the quality of daily work. </p><p>What makes the book exceptional is the level of understanding of the concepts involved imparted by the author. This is not just a rote overview of metaprogramming. You will truly understand difficult topics like static assertions, how to write metafunctions, overload resolution, lambda expressions, and many others. More than that, you will work through them with practical examples guided by the author's frank explanations. This book requires you to think and to learn and to understand the language so that you can program at a higher level.</p></span></span>",

You can start using the book immediately with the SynthLab-DM product, which allows you to compile and load mini-modules that resemble modular synth components without needing to maintain the complete synth project code. The C++ objects all run in a stand-alone mode, so you can incorporate them into your current projects or whip up a quick experiment. All six synth projects are fully documented, from the tiny <i>SynthClock </i>to the <i>SynthEngine </i>objects, allowing you to get the most from the book while working at a level that you feel comfortable with.</p><p></p><p>This book is intended for music technology and engineering students, along with DIY audio programmers and anyone wanting to understand how synthesizers may be implemented in C++.</p></span>",

Although C++ has been at the forefront of innovation and\nproductivity in software development for more than two decades, it\nis only now being fully understood and utilized. This book is one\nof those rare contributions that can bear repeated study by\npractitioners and experts alike. It is not a treatise on the arcane\nor academic—rather it completes your understanding of things\nyou think you know but will bite you sooner or later until you\nreally learn them. Few people have mastered C++ and software design\nas well as Steve has; almost no one has such a level head as he\nwhen it comes to software development. He knows what you need to\nknow, believe me. When he speaks, I always listen—closely. I\ninvite you to do the same. You (and your customers) will be glad\nyou did.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><em>—Chuck Allison, editor,</em> The C++ Source</b>\n</p><p>\n“Steve taught me C++. This was back in 1982 or 1983, I\nthink—he had just returned from an internship sitting with\nBjarne Stroustrup inventor of C++ at Bell Labs. Steve is one of the\nunsung heroes of the early days, and anything Steve writes is on my\nA-list of things to read. This book is an easy read and collects a\ngreat deal of Steve’s extensive knowledge and experience. It\nis highly recommended.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><em>—Stan Lippman, coauthor of</em> C++ Primer, Fourth\nEdition</b>\n</p><p>\n“I welcome the self-consciously non-Dummies approach of a\nshort, smart book.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><em>—Matthew P. Johnson, Columbia University</em></b>\n</p><p>\n“I agree with the author’s assessment of the types\nof programmers. I have encountered the same types in my experience\nas a developer and a book like this will go far to help bridge\ntheir knowledge gap.... I think this book complements other books,\nlike <em>Effective C++</em> by Scott Meyers. It presents everything\nin a concise and easy-to-read style.”<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><em>—Moataz Kamel, senior software designer, Motorola\nCanada</em></b>\n</p><p>\n“Dewhurst has written yet another very good book.

But some concepts and\ntechniques must be thoroughly mastered if programmers are ever to\ndo professional-quality work. This book cuts through the technical\ndetails to reveal what is commonly understood to be absolutely\nessential. In one slim volume, Steve Dewhurst distills what he and\nother experienced managers, trainers, and authors have found to be\nthe most critical knowledge required for successful C++\nprogramming. It doesn’t matter where or when you first\nlearned C++. Before you take another step, use this book as your\nguide to make sure you’ve got it right!</p><p>This book is for you if</p><li><p>You’re no “dummy,” and you need to get\nquickly up to speed in intermediate to advanced C++</p></li><li><p>You’ve had some experience in C++ programming, but\nreading intermediate and advanced C++ books is slow-going</p></li><li><p>You’ve had an introductory C++ course, but you’ve\nfound that you still can’t follow your colleagues when\nthey’re describing their C++ designs and code</p></li><li><p>You’re an experienced C or Java programmer, but you\ndon’t yet have the experience to develop nuanced C++ code and\ndesigns</p></li><li><p>You’re a C++ expert, and you’re looking for an\nalternative to answering the same questions from your\nless-experienced colleagues over and over again</p></li><p><b><em>C++ Common Knowledge</em></b> covers\nessential but commonly misunderstood topics in C++ programming and\ndesign while filtering out needless complexity in the discussion of\neach topic.

Assuming no familiarity with C++, or any other C-based language, you'll be taught everything you need to know in a logical progression of small lessons that you can work through as quickly or as slowly as you need.</p><p>C++ can be a complicated language. Writing even the most straight-forward of programs requires you to understand many disparate aspects of the language and how they interact with one another. C++ doesn't lend itself to neat compartmentalization the way other languages do. Rather than baffle you with complex chapters explaining functions, classes and statements in isolation we'll focus on teaching you how to achieve results. By learning a little bit of this and a little of that you'll soon have amassed enough knowledge to be writing non-trivial programs and will have built a solid foundation of experience that puts those previously baffling concepts into context.</p><p>In this fully-revised second edition of <em>Exploring C</em>++, you'll learn how to use the standard library early in the book. Next, you'll learn to work with operators, objects and data-sources in increasingly realistic situations. Finally, you'll start putting the pieces together to create sophisticated programs of your own design confident that you've built a firm base of experience from which to grow.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>Learn how to use C++ from first principles in a practical hands-on way.</p></li><li><p>Understand how to use Custom types, virtual functions and objects to structure your code</p></li><li><p>Build your own function templates, namespaces and containers from the ground up.</p></li><li><p>Put everything together to create sophisticated programs that work with pointers, dynamic memory and overloaded functions to achieve the results you want.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>Read this book if you want to learn C++ and have a basic understanding of how computer programs work. You don't need to know a C-based language before you start, but a basic understanding of how programs are structured is helpful.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Bridging the gap from theory to programming, <em>Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins in C++ For RackAFX, VST3 and Audio Units</em> contains complete code for designing and implementing software synthesizers for both Windows and Mac platforms. You will learn synthesizer operation, starting with the underlying theory of each synthesizer component, and moving on to the theory of how these components combine to form fully working musical instruments that function on a variety of target digital audio workstations (DAWs). Containing some of the latest advances in theory and algorithm development, this book contains information that has never been published in textbook form, including several unique algorithms of the author’s own design.</p><p></p><p>The book is broken into three parts: plug-in programming, theory and design of the central synthesizer components of oscillators, envelope generators, and filters, and the design and implementation of six complete polyphonic software synthesizer musical instruments, which can be played in real time. The instruments implement advanced concepts including a user-programmable modulation matrix. The final chapter shows you the theory and code for a suite of delay effects to augment your synthesizers, introducing you to audio effect processing.</p><p></p><p>The companion website, www.focalpress.com/cw/pirkle, gives you access to free software to guide you through the application of concepts discussed in the book, and code for both Windows and Mac platforms. In addition to the software, it features bonus projects, application notes, and video tutorials. A reader forum, monitored by the author, gives you the opportunity for questions and information exchange.</p></span>",

Its key strengths are its software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers, and performance-critical applications, not to forget its importance in game programming. Despite its strengths in these areas, beginners usually tend to shy away from learning the language because of its steep learning curve.</p><p>The main mission of this book is to make you familiar and comfortable with C++. You will finish the book not only being able to write your own code, but more importantly, you will be able to read other projects. It is only by being able to read others' code that you will progress from a beginner to an advanced programmer. This book is the first step in that progression.</p><p>The first task is to familiarize you with the structure of C++ projects so you will know how to start reading a project. Next, you will be able to identify the main structures in the language, functions, and classes, and feel confident being able to identify the execution flow through the code. You will then become aware of the facilities of the standard library and be able to determine whether you need to write a routine yourself, or use an existing routine in the standard library.</p><p>Throughout the book, there is a big emphasis on memory and pointers. You will understand memory usage, allocation, and access, and be able to write code that does not leak memory. Finally, you will learn about C++ classes and get an introduction to object orientation and polymorphism.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This straightforward tutorial will help you build strong skills in C++ programming, be it for enterprise software or for low-latency applications such as games or embedded programming. Filled with examples, this book will take you gradually up the steep learning curve of C++.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

With this book, you get access to a companion website where you can download the accompanying Rapid Plug-In Development software to compile and test the book examples, all the code examples, and view student plug-ins and tutorial videos on the development software. Start with an intuitive and practical introduction to the digital signal processing (DSP) theory behind audio plug-ins, and quickly move on to plug-in implementation, gain knowledge of algorithms on filtering, delay, reverb, modulated effects, dynamics processing, and more. You will then be ready to design and implement your own unique plug-ins on any platform and within most any host program.</p><p/><p>Readers are expected to have some knowledge of C++, and high school math. </p></span>",

But when you need a powerful, highly portable systems programming language or an application programming language with uncompromising performance, it’s hard to beat. With the 2011 and 2014 updates, C++ feels like a completely new language, rather than the old C++ with new features bolted on.</p><p>Authors Jon Kalb and Gašper Ažman demonstrate how modern C++ (C++11 and C++14) provides the power, performance, libraries, and tools necessary for massive server farms as well as low-footprint mobile apps.</p><ul><li>Delve into the modern C++ features that are generating new interest in the language</li><li>Learn why C++ is the only high-level language available on Apple, Android, and Microsoft mobile devices</li><li>Explore the C++ cloud computing appeal, including performance, high portability, and low-level hardware control</li><li>See what the future holds for C++ with proposed changes in the 2017 update</li></ul></div></span>",

Karlsson's\ntopics range from smart pointers and conversions to containers and\ndata structures, explaining exactly how using each library can\nimprove your code. He offers detailed coverage of higher-order\nfunction objects that enable you to write code that is more\nconcise, expressive, and readable. He even takes you \"behind the\nscenes\" with Boost, revealing tools and techniques for creating\nyour own generic libraries.</p><p>Coverage includes</p><li><p>Smart pointers that provide automatic lifetime management of\nobjects and simplify resource sharing</p></li><li><p>Consistent, best-practice solutions for performing type\nconversions and lexical conversions</p></li><li><p>Utility classes that make programming simpler and clearer</p></li><li><p>Flexible container libraries that solve common problems not\ncovered by the C++ Standard Library</p></li><li><p>Powerful support for regular expressions with Boost.Regex</p></li><li><p>Function objects defined at the call site with Boost.Bind and\nBoost.Lambda</p></li><li><p>More flexible callbacks with Boost.Function</p></li><li><p>Managed signals and slots (a.k.a. the Observer pattern) with\nBoost.Signals</p></li><p>The Boost libraries are proving so useful\nthat many of them are planned for inclusion in the next version of\nthe C++ Standard Library.

			"description": "<span><p>The <i>STL Pocket Reference</i> describes the functions, classes, and templates in that part of the C++ standard library often referred to as the Standard Template Library (STL). The STL encompasses containers, iterators, algorithms, and function objects, which collectively represent one of the most important and widely used subsets of standard library functionality.The C++ standard library, even the subset known as the STL, is vast. It's next to impossible to work with the STL without some sort of reference at your side to remind you of template parameters, function invocations, return types--indeed, the entire myriad of details you need to know in order to use the STL effectively and get work done. You need a memory-aid.Books that cover the standard library and the STL tend to be quite heavy and large, describing each aspect of the STL in detail. Such books are great when you're not familiar with the library, but get in the way when you simply need to remind yourself of a function name, or the order in which you pass arguments to a function. Programmers familiar with the STL need a small, lightweight memory-aid. That's what the <i>STL Pocket Reference</i> is. It's small, lightweight, and chock-full of information that you can take in at a glance, so you can get on with your work.</p></span>",

Also included are guidelines and considerations to\nremember when using standard containers and algorithms--topics\nrarely covered in-depth in other sources.</p><p>Readers will find solutions to such important questions as:</p><ul><li><p>What pitfalls might you encounter when using std::map and\nstd::set, and how can you safely avoid them?</p></li><li><p>What kinds of predicates are safe to use with the STL, what\nkinds aren't, and why?</p></li><li><p>What techniques are available for writing powerful generic\ntemplate code that can change its own behavior based on the\ncapabilities of the types it's given to work with?</p></li><li><p>When and how should you optimize your code? Why can (and do)\nfancy optimizations get us into trouble? And how can some of these\nanswers change if you're writing multithread-safe code?</p></li><li><p>Does exception safety affect class design, or can it be\nretrofitted in as an afterthought?</p></li><li><p>How can you avoid the Siamese Twin problem when combining\ninheritance-based libraries from different vendors?</p></li><li><p>How can you safely use auto_ptr, and then use common design\npatterns to adapt it to avoid common pitfalls? Can you use auto_ptr\nas a class member? What must you know before you elect to use it\nthat way?</p></li><li><p>Plus one of the most frequently recurring questions about\nmodern C++: When and how should you use namespaces, anyway?</p></li></ul><p>A must-have for the serious programmer, <b><em>More Exceptional\nC++</em></b> provides a thorough and pragmatic understanding of the\nlanguage while showing you how to write exceptional code in\nC++.</p><p><br/><br/>\n020170434XB11092001</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>A visual, interdisciplinary approach to solving problems in numerical methods</p><p>Computing for Numerical Methods Using Visual C++ fills the need for a complete, authoritative book on the visual solutions to problems in numerical methods using C++. In an age of boundless research, there is a need for a programming language that can successfully bridge the communication gap between a problem and its computing elements through the use of visual-ization for engineers and members of varying disciplines, such as biologists, medical doctors, mathematicians, economists, and politicians. This book takes an interdisciplinary approach to the subject and demonstrates how solving problems in numerical methods using C++ is dominant and practical for implementation due to its flexible language format, object-oriented methodology, and support for high numerical precisions.</p><p>In an accessible, easy-to-follow style, the authors cover:</p><ul><li><p>Numerical modeling using C++</p></li><li><p>Fundamental mathematical tools</p></li><li><p>MFC interfaces</p></li><li><p>Curve visualization</p></li><li><p>Systems of linear equations</p></li><li><p>Nonlinear equations</p></li><li><p>Interpolation and approximation</p></li><li><p>Differentiation and integration</p></li><li><p>Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors</p></li><li><p>Ordinary differential equations</p></li><li><p>Partial differential equations</p></li></ul><p>This reader-friendly book includes a companion Web site, giving readers free access to all of the codes discussed in the book as well as an equation parser called \"MyParser\" that can be used to develop various numerical applications on Windows. Computing for Numerical Methods Using Visual C++ serves as an excellent reference for students in upper undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in engineering, science, and mathematics. It is also an ideal resource for practitioners using Microsoft Visual C++.</p></span></span>",

More specifically, this is a compact collection of essential classes and functions, used by C++ programmers on a daily basis. The <em>C++ Standard Library Quick Reference</em> features core classes for strings, I/O streams, and various generic containers, as well as a comprehensive set of algorithms to manipulate them. In recent years, the C++11 and C++14 standards have added even more efficient container classes, a new powerful regular expression library, and a portable multithreading library featuring threads, mutexes, condition variables, and atomic variables.</p><p>Needless to say, it is hard to know and remember all the possibilities, details, and intricacies of this vast and growing library. This handy reference guide is therefore indispensable to any C++ programmer. It offers a condensed, well-structured summary of all essential aspects of the C++ Standard Library, including all aforementioned functionality. No page-long, repetitive examples or obscure, rarely used features. Instead, everything you need to know and watch out for in practice is outlined in a compact, to-the-point style, interspersed with well-chosen, clarifying examples. The book does not explain the C++ language or syntax, but is accessible to anyone with basic C++ knowledge. Even the most experienced C++ programmer though will learn a thing or two from it and find it a useful memory-aid.</p></span></span>",
