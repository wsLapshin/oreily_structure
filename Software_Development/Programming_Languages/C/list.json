			"description": "<span><div><p>Ever wished you could learn C from a book? <i>Head First C</i> provides a complete learning experience for C and structured imperative programming. With a unique method that goes beyond syntax and how-to manuals, this guide not only teaches you the language, it helps you understand how to be a great programmer. You'll learn key areas such as language basics, pointers and pointer arithmetic, and dynamic memory management. Advanced topics include multi-threading and network programming—topics typically covered on a college-level course.</p><p>This book also features labs: in-depth projects intended to stretch your abilities, test your new skills, and build confidence. Head First C mimics the style of college-level C courses, making it ideal as an accessible textbook for students.</p><p>We think your time is too valuable to waste struggling with new concepts. Using the latest research in cognitive science and learning theory to craft a multi-sensory learning experience, Head First C uses a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works, not a text-heavy approach that puts you to sleep.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>This book is meant to help the reader learn how to program in C. It is the definitive reference guide, now in a second edition. Although the first edition was written in 1978, it continues to be a worldwide best-seller. This second edition brings the classic original up to date to include the ANSI standard.</p><p>From the Preface:</p><p>We have tried to retain the brevity of the first edition. C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book. We have improved the exposition of critical features, such as pointers, that are central to C programming. We have refined the original examples, and have added new examples in several chapters. For instance, the treatment of complicated declarations is augmented by programs that convert declarations into words and vice versa. As before, all examples have been tested directly from the text, which is in machine-readable form.</p><p>As we said in the first preface to the first edition, C \"wears well as one's experience with it grows.\" With a decade more experience, we still feel that way. We hope that this book will help you to learn C and use it well.</p></div></span>",

Forget\nold-fashioned C programming books that assume you're a computer\nhardware expert and teach frustrating, old-fashioned coding styles.\nIf you know any language at all, Zed A. Shaw's <em>Learn C the Hard\nWay</em> can help you get started fast with modern C programming.\nThis book/CD package is called \"The Hard Way,\" but it's really\nquite easy: it just requires discipline, practice, and persistence.\nShaw teaches how to write modern, clean, clear C code through\ndozens of brilliantly-crafted exercises, most on two pages. You\nsimply read each exercise, type in its sample code precisely (no\ncopy-and-paste!), and make the programs run. As you read, type, fix\nyour mistakes, and watch the results, you learn how C works…\nwhat good modern C programs look like… how to read, write,\nand \"see\" code… how to spot crucial differences that change\nor break programs… all the essentials of C logic, I/O,\nvariables, and functions… and the attention to detail that is\nindispensable to successful C programming. At first, yes, it can be\ndifficult. But it gets easier. And Shaw offers plenty of extra help\nthrough 5+ full hours of CD-based teaching video. Nothing important\ncomes without discipline, practice, and persistence. But, with this\npackage, if you bring those qualities, you <em>will</em> master\nC… and you <em>will</em> reap the very real personal and career\nrewards that go with C programming expertise!</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p/><div><p>There are many books on data structures and algorithms, including some with useful libraries of C functions. <i>Mastering Algorithms with C</i> offers you a unique combination of theoretical background and working code. With robust solutions for everyday programming tasks, this book avoids the abstract style of most classic data structures and algorithms texts, but still provides all of the information you need to understand the purpose and use of common programming techniques.</p><p>Implementations, as well as interesting, real-world examples of each data structure and algorithm, are included.</p><p>Using both a programming style and a writing style that are exceptionally clean, Kyle Loudon shows you how to use such essential data structures as lists, stacks, queues, sets, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs. He explains how to use algorithms for sorting, searching, numerical analysis, data compression, data encryption, common graph problems, and computational geometry. And he describes the relative efficiency of all implementations. The compression and encryption chapters not only give you working code for reasonably efficient solutions, they offer explanations of concepts in an approachable manner for people who never have had the time or expertise to study them in depth.</p><p>Anyone with a basic understanding of the C language can use this book. In order to provide maintainable and extendible code, an extra level of abstraction (such as pointers to functions) is used in examples where appropriate. Understanding that these techniques may be unfamiliar to some programmers, Loudon explains them clearly in the introductory chapters.</p><p>Contents include:</p><ul><li>Pointers</li><li>Recursion</li><li>Analysis of algorithms</li><li>Data structures (lists, stacks, queues, sets, hash tables, trees, heaps, priority queues, graphs)</li><li>Sorting and searching</li><li>Numerical methods</li><li>Data compression</li><li>Data encryption</li><li>Graph algorithms</li><li>Geometric algorithms</li></ul></div></span>",

Unlike some modern\nobject-oriented languages, C provides little linguistic support or\nmotivation for creating reusable application programming interfaces\n(APIs). While most C programmers use APIs and the libraries that\nimplement them in almost every application they write, relatively\nfew programmers create and disseminate new, widely applicable APIs.\n<em>C Interfaces and Implementations</em> shows how to create\nreusable APIs using interface-based design, a language-independent\nmethodology that separates interfaces from their implementations.\nThis methodology is explained by example. The author describes in\ndetail 24 interfaces and their implementations, providing the\nreader with a thorough understanding of this design approach.</p><p>Features of <em>C Interfaces and Implementations</em>:</p><ul><li><p>Concise interface descriptions that comprise a reference manual\nfor programmers interested in using the interfaces.</p></li><li><p>A guided tour of the code that implements each chapter's\ninterface tp help those modifying or extending an interface or\ndesigning related interfaces.</p></li><li><p>In-depth focus on \"algorithm engineering:\" how to package data\nstructures and related algorithms into reusable modules.</p></li><li><p>Source code for 24 APIs and 8 sample applications is examined,\nwith each presented as a \"literate program\" in which a thorough\nexplanation is interleaved with the source code.</p></li><li><p>Rarely documented C programming tricks-of-the-trade.</p></li><li><p>Convenient access to all source code in the book via the World\nWide Web at http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/cii/</p></li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><p/><div><p>There are lots of introductory C books, but this is the first one that has the no-nonsense, practical approach that has made Nutshell Handbooks(R) famous.C programming is more than just getting the syntax right. Style and debugging also play a tremendous part in creating programs that run well and are easy to maintain. This book teaches you not only the mechanics of programming, but also describes how to create programs that are easy to read, debug, and update.Practical rules are stressed. For example, there are fifteen precedence rules in C (&amp;&amp; comes before || comes before ?:). The practical programmer reduces these to two:</p><ul><li>Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction.</li></ul>Contrary to popular belief, most programmers do not spend most of their time creating code. Most of their time is spent modifying someone else's  code.  This books shows you how to avoid the all-too-common obfuscated uses  of C (and also to recognize these uses when you encounter them in existing programs) and thereby to leave code that the programmer responsible for maintenance does not have to struggle with. Electronic Archaeology, the art  of going through someone else's code, is described.This third edition introduces popular Integrated Development Environments  on Windows systems, as well as UNIX programming utilities, and features a large statistics-generating program to pull together the concepts and  features in the language.</div></span>",

The use of real programs in page-size (or less) chunks that can be easily understood is a real plus. The figures, programs, and tables are a significant contribution to the learning experience of the reader; they make this book distinctive.</em></p><p><strong><em>— William A. Ward, University of South Alabama</em></strong></p><p>Robert Sedgewick has thoroughly rewritten and substantially expanded his popular work to provide current and comprehensive coverage of important algorithms and data structures. Many new algorithms are presented, and the explanations of each algorithm are much more detailed than in previous editions. A new text design and detailed, innovative figures, with accompanying commentary, greatly enhance the presentation. The third edition retains the successful blend of theory and practice that has made Sedgewick’s work an invaluable resource for more than 250,000 programmers!</p><p>This particular book, Parts 1-4, represents the essential first half of Sedgewick’s complete work. It provides extensive coverage of fundamental data structures and algorithms for sorting, searching, and related applications. The algorithms and data structures are expressed in concise implementations in C, so that you can both appreciate their fundamental properties and test them on real applications. Of course, the substance of the book applies to programming in any language.</p><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><ul><li><p>Expanded coverage of arrays, linked lists, strings, trees, and other basic data structures</p></li><li><p>Greater emphasis on abstract data types (ADTs) than in previous editions</p></li><li><p>Over 100 algorithms for sorting, selection, priority queue ADT implementations, and symbol table ADT (searching) implementations</p></li><li><p>New implementations of binomial queues, multiway radix sorting, Batcher’s sorting networks, randomized BSTs, splay trees, skip lists, multiway tries, and much more</p></li><li><p>Increased quantitative information about the algorithms, including extensive empirical studies and basic analytic studies, giving you a basis for comparing them</p></li><li><p>Over 1000 new exercises to help you learn the properties of algorithms</p></li></ul><p>Whether you are a student learning the algorithms for the first time or a professional interested in having up-to-date reference material, you will find a wealth of useful information in this book.</p></div></span>",

The author carefully takes into account the special concerns found in designing and developing embedded applications specifically concurrency, communication, speed, and memory usage. Patterns are given in UML (Unified Modeling Language) with examples including ANSI C for direct and practical application to C code. <br/><br/>A basic C knowledge is a prerequisite for the book while UML notation and terminology is included. General C programming books do not include discussion of the contraints found within embedded system design. The practical examples give the reader an understanding of the use of UML and OO (Object Oriented) designs in a resource-limited environment. Also included are two chapters on state machines. The beauty of this book is that it can help you today. .<ul><li>Design Patterns within these pages are immediately applicable to your project</li><li>Addresses embedded system design concerns such as concurrency, communication, and memory usage</li><li>Examples contain ANSI C for ease of use with C programming code</li></ul>\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><span><div><p>Learning a language--any language--involves a process wherein you learn to rely less and less on instruction and more increasingly on the aspects of the language you've mastered. Whether you're learning French, Java, or C, at some point you'll set aside the tutorial and attempt to converse on your own. It's not necessary to know every subtle facet of French in order to speak it well, especially if there's a good dictionary available. Likewise, C programmers don't need to memorize every detail of C in order to write good programs. What they need instead is a reliable, comprehensive reference that they can keep nearby. <i>C in a Nutshell</i> is that reference.</p><p>This long-awaited book is a complete reference to the C programming language and C runtime library. Its purpose is to serve as a convenient, reliable companion in your day-to-day work as a C programmer.  C in a Nutshell covers virtually everything you need to program in C, describing all the elements of the language and illustrating their use with numerous examples.</p><p>The book is divided into three distinct parts.  The first part is a fast-paced description, reminiscent of the classic Kernighan &amp; Ritchie text on which many C programmers cut their teeth.  It focuses specifically on the C language and preprocessor directives, including extensions introduced to the ANSI standard in 1999.  These topics and others are covered: </p><p/><ul><li>Numeric constants</li><li>Implicit and explicit type conversions</li><li>Expressions and operators</li><li>Functions</li><li>Fixed-length and variable-length arrays</li><li>Pointers</li><li>Dynamic memory management</li><li>Input and output</li></ul><p>The second part of the book is a comprehensive reference to the C runtime library; it includes an overview of the contents of the standard headers and a description of each standard library function.  Part III provides the necessary knowledge of the C programmer's basic tools: the compiler, the make utility, and the debugger.  The tools described here are those in the GNU software collection.</p><p><i>C in a Nutshell</i> is the perfect companion to K&amp;R, and destined to be the most reached-for reference on your desk.</p></div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p/><p><em><strong>Sudoku Programming with C</strong></em> teaches you how to write computer programs to solve and generate Sudoku puzzles. This is a practical book that will provide you with everything you need to write your own books of Sudoku Classic and Samurai puzzles. But be warned: after reading it, you'll discover that the puzzles in your local paper are not so challenging after all!</p><p>We like Sudokus because they test our capacity to recognize and interpret patterns. But how are the clues generated? Where do those quasi-symmetrical configurations come from? When the author explored the Web to find out, he discovered that there were many sites that explained how to solve Sudokus, but none that told him how create them. He also saw many sites and apps to play Sudoku, but, perhaps not surprising, no indication of how they worked. </p><p>So, he had to develop his own applications in order to find out. And, from the very start, he decided that he would publish the code for anyone else to use and perhaps tinker with, but the author wrote it in such a way that also lets readers with limited knowledge of programming techniques understand it. In fact, you could decide to start generating thousands of puzzles almost immediately, and go through the explanations of algorithms and techniques later, a bit at a time. The author chose to write the application in ‘plain old C’ because he wanted to make the code accessible to as many people as possible.</p><p>In this book, you will find an explanation of all solving strategies, and the code to implement them. Writing the Solver application was more difficult than writing the Generator, because it required designing and implementing each strategy separately. However, the author wanted to include a solving program capable of listing the strategies necessary to solve any particular puzzle. He also wanted to check whether a puzzle was solvable analytically, without any guessing.</p><p>This book includes the full listings of both the Generator and the Solver, and explanations of all C modules, with walk-throughs and examples.</p></span></span>",

This book's aim is to first introduce the basic building blocks such as elaborate details about memory, the compilation process (parsing/preprocessing/assembler/object code generation), the runtime memory organization of an executable and virtual memory. These basic building blocks will help both beginners and advanced readers to grasp the notion of pointers very easily and clearly. The book is enriched with several illustrations, pictorial examples, and code from different contexts (Device driver code snippets, algorithm, and data structures code where pointers are used).</p><p><em>Pointers in C</em> contains several quick tips which will be useful for programmers for not just learning the pointer concept but also while using other features of the C language. Chapters in the book are intuitive, and there is a strict logical flow among them and each chapter forms a basis for the next chapter.

			"description": "<span><div><b>How to Resolve the Really Hard Problems</b><br/><br/>Every manager makes tough callsit comes with the job. And the hardest decisions are the gray areas”situations where you and your team have worked hard to find an answer, you’ve done the best analysis you can, and you still don’t know what to do. But you have to make a decision. You have to choose, commit, act, and live with the consequences and persuade others to follow your lead. Gray areas test your skills as a manager, your judgment, and even your humanity. How do you get these decisions right?<br/><br/>In <i>Managing in the Gray</i>, Joseph Badaracco offers a powerful, practical, and even radical way to resolve these problems. Picking up where conventional tools of analysis leave off, this book provides <i>tools for judgment</i> in the form of five revealing questions. Asking yourself these five questions provides a simple yet profound way to broaden your thinking, sharpen your judgment, and develop a fresh perspective. What makes these questions so valuable is that they have truly stood the test of timethey’ve guided countless men and women, across many centuries and cultures, to resolve the hardest questions of work, responsibility, and life.<br/><br/>You can use the five-question framework on your own or with others on your team to help you cut through complexities, understand critical trade-offs, and develop workable solutions for even the grayest issues.<br/></div></span>",

Once you learn the principles well, they can be applied to any language. If you are worried that you are not good at high-school mathematics, don’t be.

Originally, C was designed for writing ‘systems’ programs—things like operating systems, editors, compilers, assemblers and input/output utility programs.

Ray Jeffery coined the term in the early 1970s, and Tim Crowe wrote the first CPTED applications book. The second edition of <b><i>21st Century Security and CPTED</i></b> includes the latest theory, knowledge, and practice of CPTED as it relates to the current security threats facing the modern world: theft, violent crime, terrorism, gang activity, and school and workplace violence.<br/><br/>This significantly expanded edition includes the latest coverage of proper lighting, building design—both the interior and exterior—physical security barriers, the usage of fencing, bollards, natural surveillance, landscaping, and landscape design. Such design concepts and security elements can be applied to address a wide variety of threats including crime prevention, blast mitigation, and CBRNE threat protection.<br/><br/>Authored by one of the U.S.’s renowned security experts—and a premiere architect and criminologist—the book is the most comprehensive examination of CPTED and CPTED principles available. This edition includes a complete update of all chapters in addition to five new chapters, over 700 figure illustrations and photos, numerous tables and checklists, and a 20-page color plate section. This latest edition:</p><ul><li>Features five new chapters including green and sustainable buildings, infrastructure protection, and premises liability</li><li>Presents step-by-step guidelines and real-world applications of CPTED concepts, principles and processes—from risk assessment to construction and post-occupancy evaluation</li><li>Outlines national building security codes and standards</li><li>Examines architectural surety from the perspective of risk analysis and premises liability</li><li>Demonstrates CPTED implementation in high-security environments, such as hospitals, parks, ATMs, schools, and public and private sector buildings</li><p/></ul><p>A practical resource for architects, urban planners and designers, security managers, law enforcement, CPTED practitioners, building and property managers, homeland security professionals, and students, <b><i>21st Century Security and CPTED, Second Edition</i></b>continues to serve as the most complete and up-to-date reference available on next-generation CPTED practices today.<br/><br/></p></span></span>",

The principles precede the applications in most cases in an attempt to provide genuine understanding and encourage further development. Readers will gain much from the hands-on experience the authors' approach provides, an approach designed to enable readers to climb steep learning curves with the minimum amount of assistance. <br/><br/>The many programs included in the text provide the essential hands-on experience. Some of the programs inevitably become rather lengthy, so the source code used is available as a free download from the Newnes website. The aim of the book, however, is to give the reader enough confidence to rewrite and improve these programs.<br/><br/>In the second edition Mike James has thoroughly updated all aspects relating to software, operating systems and graphical interfaces. He has also increased the scope of the book to include current forms of C++. Material on data acquisition has been thoroughly updated and the section on peripherals increased.<ul><li>A practical and painless way of becoming an expert C programmer</li><li>New edition also covers C++ and the Windows environment</li><li>Get up to speed with the essential maths needed for C without having to buy a university maths text!</li></ul>\n</span>",

As the\nbest-selling author of guides to PHP, MySQL, and more, he's proved\nthat programming doesn't have to be painful, especially when it\ncomes to a language that is at its core both simple and small.\nWe're talking, of course, about C, and if you want to learn it fast\n(not to mention well), this book provides the key. Joined by\nco-author and fellow programmer Marc Liyanage, this author team\ntackles both programming fundamentals and the ABCs of C itself\nthrough a series of task-based lessons that use step-by-step\ninstructions and a plethora of visual aids to make C if not\ninstantly accessible, then almost. This book uses friendly,\nstraightforward language to explain every aspect of this\nfundamental technology: from basic syntax and data types to working\nwith numbers, characters, loops, and arrays; creating functions;\nusing the C preprocessor; file input and output; and more.</p></span></span></span>",
