Learn to use the many features of this highly concise, fluent, elegant, and expressive statically typed language with easy-to-understand examples. Learn to write easy-to-maintain, high-performing JVM and Android applications, create DSLs, program asynchrony, and much more.</p><p>Kotlin is a highly concise, elegant, fluent, and expressive statically typed multi-paradigm language. It is one of the few languages that compiles down to both Java bytecode and JavaScript. You can use it to build server-side, front-end, and Android applications.

If you want to learn the essentials of Kotlin, from the fundamentals to more advanced concepts, you've picked the right book.</p><p>Fire up your favorite IDE and practice hundreds of examples and exercises to sharpen your Kotlin skills. Learn to build standalone small programs to run as scripts, create type safe code, and then carry that knowledge forward to create fully object-oriented and functional style code that's easier to extend. Learn how to program with elegance but without compromising efficiency or performance, and how to use metaprogramming to build highly expressive code and create internal DSLs that exploit the fluency of the language. Explore coroutines, program asynchrony, run automated tests, and intermix Kotlin with Java in your enterprise applications.</p><p>This book will help you master one of the few languages that you can use for the entire full stack - from the server to mobile devices - to create performant, concise, and easy to maintain applications.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>To try out the examples in the book you'll need a computer with Kotlin SDK, JDK, and a text editor or a Kotlin IDE installed in it.</p></div></span>",

			"title": "Getting Clojure",
			"description": "<span><div><p>Behind every programming language lies a <i>vision</i> of how programs should be built. The vision behind Clojure is of a radically simple language framework holding together a sophisticated collection of programming features.  Learning Clojure involves much more than just learning the mechanics of the language. To really <i>get</i> Clojure you need to understand the <i>ideas</i> underlying this structure of framework and features. You need this book: an accessible introduction to Clojure that focuses on the <i>ideas</i> behind the language as well as the practical details of writing code.</p><p>Clojure attracts developers on the cutting edge and is arguably the best language for learning to program in the functional style without compromise. But this comes with a steep learning curve. <i>Getting Clojure</i> directly addresses this by teaching you how to think functionally as it teaches you the language. You'll learn about Clojure's powerful data structures and high-level functions, but you'll also learn what it means for a language to be functional, and how to think in Clojure's functional way.</p><p>Each chapter of <i>Getting Clojure</i> takes a feature or two or three from the language, explains the syntax and the mechanics behind that feature so that you can make it work before digging into the deeper questions: What is the thinking behind the feature? And how does it fit in with the rest of the language? In <i>Getting Clojure</i> you'll learn Clojure's very simple syntax, but you'll also learn why that syntax is integral the way the language is constructed. You'll discover that most data structures in Clojure are immutable, but also why that leads to more reliable programs. And you'll see how easy it is to write Clojure functions and also how you can use those functions to build complex and capable systems.</p><p>With real-world examples of how working Clojure programmers use the language, <i>Getting Clojure</i> will help you see the challenges of programming through the eye of experienced Clojure developers.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p/><p>You will need to some background in programming. To follow along with the examples in the book, you will need Java 6 or new, Clojure 1.8 or 1.9, and Leiningen 2.</p></div></span>",

You'll begin by learning about the practical aspects of smarter coding in Kotlin, as well as understanding basic Kotlin syntax and the impact of design patterns on your code.</p><p>The book also provides an in-depth explanation of the classical design patterns, such as Creational, Structural, and Behavioral families, before moving on to functional programming. You'll go through reactive and concurrent patterns, and finally, get to grips with coroutines and structured concurrency to write performant, extensible, and maintainable code.</p><p>By the end of this Kotlin book, you'll have explored the latest trends in architecture and design patterns for microservices. You'll also understand the tradeoffs when choosing between different architectures and make informed decisions. </p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Implement all the classical design patterns using the Kotlin programming language</li><li>Apply reactive and concurrent design patterns to make your application more scalable</li><li>Discover best practices in Kotlin and explore its new features</li><li>Understand the key principles of functional programming and learn how they apply to Kotlin</li><li>Find out how to write idiomatic Kotlin code and learn which patterns to avoid</li><li>Harness the power of Kotlin to design concurrent and reliable systems with ease</li><li>Create an effective microservice with Kotlin and the Ktor framework</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for developers who want to apply design patterns they've learned from other languages in Kotlin and build reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications. You'll need a good grasp on at least one programming language before you get started with this book. Java or design patterns will be particularly useful, but you'll still be able to follow along if you code in other languages.</p></span>",

			"title": "Programming Clojure, 3rd Edition",
			"description": "<span><div><p>Drowning in unnecessary complexity, unmanaged state, and tangles of spaghetti code? In the best tradition of Lisp, Clojure gets out of your way so you can focus on expressing simple solutions to hard problems. Clojure cuts through complexity by providing a set of composable tools--immutable data, functions, macros, and the interactive REPL. Written by members of the Clojure core team, this book is the essential, definitive guide to Clojure. This new edition includes information on all the newest features of Clojure, such as transducers and specs.</p><p/><p>Clojure joins the flexibility and agility of Lisp with the reach, stability, and performance of Java. Combine Clojure's tools for maximum effectiveness as you work with immutable data, functional programming, and safe concurrency to write programs that solve real-world problems.</p><p>Start by reading and understanding Clojure syntax and see how Clojure is evaluated. From there, find out about the sequence abstraction, which combines immutable collections with functional programming to create truly reusable data transformation code. Clojure is a functional language; learn how to write programs in a functional style, and when and how to use recursion to your advantage. Discover Clojure's unique approach to state and identity, techniques for polymorphism and open systems using multimethods and protocols, and how to leverage Clojure's metaprogramming capabilities via macros. Finally, put all the pieces together in a real program.</p><p>New to this edition is coverage of Clojure's spec library, one of the most interesting new features of Clojure for describing both data and functions. You can use Clojure spec to validate data, destructure data, explain invalid data, and generate large numbers of tests to verify the correctness of your code.</p><p>With this book, you'll learn how to think in Clojure, and how to take advantage of its combined strengths to build powerful programs quickly.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><li>Java 6 or higher</li><li>Clojure 1.9</li></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Start building native Android apps the modern way in Kotlin with Jetpack's expansive set of tools, libraries, and best practices. Learn how to create efficient, resilient views with Fragments and share data between the views with ViewModels. Use Room to persist valuable data quickly, and avoid NullPointerExceptions and Java's verbose expressions with Kotlin. You can even handle asynchronous web service calls elegantly with Kotlin coroutines. Achieve all of this and much more while building two full-featured apps, following detailed, step-by-step instructions.With Kotlin and Jetpack, Android development is now smoother and more enjoyable than ever before. Dive right in by developing two complete Android apps.</p><p>With the first app, Penny Drop, you create a full game complete with random die rolls, customizable rules, and AI opponents.  Build lightweight Fragment views with data binding, quickly and safely update data with ViewModel classes, and handle all app navigation in a single location.  Use Kotlin with Android-specific Kotlin extensions to efficiently write null-safe code without all the normal boilerplate required for pre-Jetpack + Kotlin apps.  Persist and retrieve data as full objects with the Room library, then display that data with ViewModels and list records in a RecyclerView.</p><p>Next, you create the official app for the Android Baseball League.  It's a fake league but a real app, where you use what you learn in Penny Drop and build up from there. Navigate all over the app via a Navigation Drawer, including specific locations via Android App Links. Handle asynchronous and web service calls with Kotlin Coroutines, display that data smoothly with the Paging library, and send notifications to a user's phone from your app.</p><p>Come build Android apps the modern way with Kotlin and Jetpack!</p><p><br/><br/></p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You'll need the Android SDK, a text editor, and either a real Android device or emulator for testing. While not strictly required, it's assumed you're using Android Studio, which comes with the Android SDK and simplifies creating an emulator. Also, a few examples require JDK 1.8 or later, though all of these pieces can be completed in other ways when using JDK 1.6.</p></div></span>",

KMM helps mobile teams share code between Android and iOS in a flexible way, leaving room for native development.</p><p>The book begins by helping you to gain a clear understanding of the Kotlin Multiplatform approach, how it works, and how it is different from cross-platform technologies, such as React Native and Flutter, and code sharing options, such as C++. You'll then see how your team can use this software development kit (SDK) to build native applications more effectively by learning timeless concepts and working through practical examples. As you advance, you'll get to grips with the core concepts, understand why UI sharing fails, and get hands-on with developing a small KMM application. Finally, you'll discover expert tips and best practices, along with production- and adoption-related questions, that will help you take the next step in your project and career.</p><p>By the end of this Kotlin book, you'll have gained a solid understanding of the capabilities of KMM and be able to share code between Android and iOS flexibly.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Get acquainted with the multiplatform approach and KMM's competitive edge</li><li>Understand how Kotlin Multiplatform works under the hood</li><li>Get up and running with the Kotlin language quickly in the context of Swift</li><li>Find out how to share code between Android and iOS</li><li>Explore tips and best practices in KMM to increase app development efficiency</li><li>Discover adoption tips to integrate KMM into existing or new production apps</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>This book is for native Android and iOS developers who want to build high-quality apps using an efficient development process.

Every chapter is centered around building something.</p><p>As you progress through the book, you will progressively develop the 'muscle memory' that will make you a productive Clojure programmer, and help you see the world through the concepts of functional programming. You will also gain familiarity with common idioms and patterns, as well as exposure to some of the most widely used libraries.</p><p>Unlike many Clojure books, this Workshop will include significant coverage of both Clojure and ClojureScript. This makes it useful no matter your goal or preferred platform, and provides a fresh perspective on the hosted nature of the language.</p><p>By the end of this book, you'll have the knowledge, skills and confidence to creatively tackle your own ambitious projects with Clojure and ClojureScript.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Write idiomatic code with Clojure and ClojureScript</li><li>Understand and use common patterns and best practices</li><li>Experiment with code and interact with programs using the REPL</li><li>Learn the fundamentals of functional programming and immutability</li><li>Master concepts including mapping, filtering, reducing and recursion</li><li>Structure and build your code using namespaces and Leiningen</li><li>Write unit tests to validate application behavior</li><li>Simplify your code and improve efficiency with macros</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>The Clojure Workshop is for anyone who is curious about functional programming and wants to get started learning Clojure or ClojureScript. Prior experience of another programming language, such as Java or JavaScript, is recommended, and will help you grasp the concepts covered in this book more easily.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>Take advantage of Kotlin's concurrency primitives to write efficient multithreaded applications</b></p><h4>Key Features</h4><ul><li>Learn Kotlin's unique approach to multithreading\n</li><li>Work through practical examples that will help you write concurrent non-blocking code\n</li><li>Improve the overall execution speed in multiprocessor and multicore systems\n</li></ul><h4>Book Description</h4><p>The primary requirements of modern-day applications are scalability, speed, and making the most use of hardware. Kotlin meets these requirements with its immense support for concurrency. Many concurrent primitives of Kotlin, such as channels and suspending functions, are designed to be non-blocking and efficient. This allows for new approaches to concurrency and creates unique challenges for the design and implementation of concurrent code. Learning Concurrency in Kotlin addresses those challenges with real-life examples and exercises that take advantage of Kotlin's primitives. Beginning with an introduction to Kotlin's coroutines, you will learn how to write concurrent code and understand the fundamental concepts needed to be able to write multithreaded software in Kotlin. You'll explore how to communicate between and synchronize your threads and coroutines to write asynchronous applications that are collaborative.

No knowledge of Groovy is required, although it will be helpful. This book does not teach Groovy, but quickly introduces the basic ideas of Groovy. An experienced Java developer should have no problems with these and move quickly on to the more involved aspects of creating DSLs with Groovy. No experience of creating a DSL is required.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Familiarize yourself with Groovy scripting and work with Groovy closures</li><li>Use the meta-programming features in Groovy to build mini languages</li><li>Employ Groovy mark-up and builders to simplify application development</li><li>Familiarize yourself with Groovy mark-up and build your own Groovy builders</li><li>Build effective DSLs with operator overloading, command chains, builders, and a host of other Groovy language features</li><li>Integrate Groovy with your Java and JVM based applications</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>The times when developing on the JVM meant you were a Java programmer have long passed. The JVM is now firmly established as a polyglot development environment with many projects opting for alternative development languages to Java such as Groovy, Scala, Clojure, and JRuby. In this pantheon of development languages, Groovy stands out for its excellent DSL enabling features which allows it to be manipulated to produce mini languages that are tailored to a project's needs.</p><p>A comprehensive tutorial on designing and developing mini Groovy based Domain Specific Languages, this book will guide you through the development of several mini DSLs that will help you gain all the skills needed to develop your own Groovy based DSLs with confidence and ease.</p><p>Starting with the bare basics, this book will focus on how Groovy can be used to construct domain specific mini languages, and will go through the more complex meta-programming features of Groovy, including using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). Practical examples are used throughout this book to de-mystify these seemingly complex language features and to show how they can be used to create simple and elegant DSLs. Packed with examples, including several fully worked DSLs, this book will serve as a springboard for developing your own DSLs.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book is a hands-on guide that will walk you through examples for building DSLs with Groovy rather than just talking about \"metaprogramming with Groovy\".

The\nresult: applications that are faster, more responsive to users, and\noften easier to maintain. Threaded programming is particularly well\nsuited to network programming where it helps alleviate the\nbottleneck of slow network I/O.</p><p>This book offers an in-depth description of\nthe IEEE operating system interface standard, POSIXAE (Portable\nOperating System Interface) threads, commonly called Pthreads.\nWritten for experienced C programmers, but assuming no previous\nknowledge of threads, the book explains basic concepts such as\nasynchronous programming, the lifecycle of a thread, and\nsynchronization. You then move to more advanced topics such as\nattributes objects, thread-specific data, and realtime scheduling.\nAn entire chapter is devoted to \"real code,\" with a look at\nbarriers, read/write locks, the work queue manager, and how to\nutilize existing libraries. In addition, the book tackles one of\nthe thorniest problems faced by thread programmers-debugging-with\nvaluable suggestions on how to avoid code errors and performance\nproblems from the outset.</p><p>Numerous annotated examples are used to\nillustrate real-world concepts. A Pthreads mini-reference and a\nlook at future standardization are also included.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Functional Programming Patterns in Scala and Clojure",
			"description": "<span><span><p>Solve real-life programming problems with a fraction of the code that pure object-oriented programming requires. Use Scala and Clojure to solve in-depth problems with two sets of patterns: object-oriented patterns that become more concise with functional programming, and natively functional patterns. Your code will be more declarative, with fewer bugs and lower maintenance costs.<br/><br/>Functional languages have their own patterns that enable you to solve problems with less code than object-oriented programming alone.  This book introduces you, the experienced Java programmer, to Scala and Clojure: practical, production-quality languages that run on the JVM and interoperate with existing Java.  By using both the statically typed, type-inferred Scala and the dynamically typed, modern Lisp Clojure, you'll gain a broad understanding of functional programming.<br/><br/>For each pattern, you'll first see the traditional object-oriented solution, and then dig into the functional replacements in both Scala and Clojure.  These patterns are common in the functional world and deserve to become part of your  problem-solving toolkit.  On the object-oriented side, you'll see many common patterns, such as Command, Strategy, and Null Object.  On the functional side, you'll learn core functional patterns such as Memoization, Lazy Sequence, and Tail Recursion.<br/><br/>Each pattern helps you solve a common programming problem. Working through them gives you a set of patterns you can use to solve problems you come across while writing programs.  Finally, you'll learn how to work your existing Java code into new Scala or Clojure projects.  You can start off small, adding functional code little by little, so you can complement your existing knowledge with Scala and Clojure as these languages gain popularity on the JVM.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Modern Systems Programming with Scala Native",
			"description": "<span><div><p>Access the power of bare-metal systems programming with Scala Native, an ahead-of-time Scala compiler. Without the baggage of legacy frameworks and virtual machines, Scala Native lets you re-imagine how your programs interact with your operating system. Compile Scala code down to native machine instructions; seamlessly invoke operating system APIs for low-level networking and IO; control pointers, arrays, and other memory management techniques for extreme performance; and enjoy instant start-up times. Skip the JVM and improve your code performance by getting close to the metal.</p><p>Developers generally build systems on top of the work of those who came before, accumulating layer upon layer of abstraction. Scala Native provides a rare opportunity to remove layers. Without the JVM, Scala Native uses POSIX and ANSI C APIs to build concise, expressive programs that run unusually close to bare metal. Scala Native compiles Scala code down to native machine instructions instead of JVM bytecode. It starts up fast, without the sluggish warm-up phase that's common for just-in-time compilers. Scala Native programs can seamlessly invoke operating system APIs for low-level networking and IO. And Scala Native lets you control pointers, arrays, and other memory layout types for extreme performance.</p><p>Write practical, bare-metal code with Scala Native, step by step. Understand the foundations of systems programming, including pointers, arrays, strings, and memory management. Use the UNIX socket API to write network client and server programs without the sort of frameworks higher-level languages rely on. Put all the pieces together to design and implement a modern, asynchronous microservice-style HTTP framework from scratch.</p><p/>Take advantage of Scala Native's clean, modern syntax to write lean, high-performance code without the JVM.<p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>A modern Windows, Mac OS, or Linux system capable of running Docker. All code examples in the book are designed to run on a portable Docker-based build environment that runs anywhere. If you don't have Docker yet, see the Appendix for instructions on how to get it.</p></div></span>",

Its functional programming (FP) features are a boon to help you design ?easy to reason about? systems to control the growing software complexities. Knowing how and where to apply the many Scala techniques is challenging. Looking at Scala best practices in the context of what you already know helps you grasp these concepts quickly, and helps you see where and why to use them.</p><p>This book begins with the rationale behind patterns to help you understand where and why each pattern is applied. You will discover what tail recursion brings to your table and will get an understanding of how to create solutions without mutations. We then explain the concept of memorization and infinite sequences for on-demand computation. Further, the book takes you through Scala's stackable traits and dependency injection, a popular technique to produce loosely-coupled software systems.</p><p>You will also explore how to currying favors to your code and how to simplify it by de-construction via pattern matching. We also show you how to do pipeline transformations using higher order functions such as the pipes and filters pattern. Then we guide you through the increasing importance of concurrent programming and the pitfalls of traditional code concurrency. Lastly, the book takes a paradigm shift to show you the different techniques that functional programming brings to your plate.</p><p>This book is an invaluable source to help you understand and perform functional programming and solve common programming problems using Scala's programming patterns.</p><p><b>Style and approach </b></p><p>This is a hands-on guide to Scala's game-changing features for programming.</p><p>It is filled with many code examples and figures that illustrate various Scala idioms and best practices.</p></span>",

Whether you're tasked with delivering a specific analytics project or simply suspect that you could be deriving more value from your data, this book will inspire you with the opportunities?and inform you of the risks?that exist in data of all shapes and sizes.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Perform hypothesis testing and understand feature selection and statistical significance to interpret your results with confidence</li><li>Implement the core machine learning techniques of regression, classification, clustering and recommendation</li><li>Understand the importance of the value of simple statistics and distributions in exploratory data analysis</li><li>Scale algorithms to web-sized datasets efficiently using distributed programming models on Hadoop and Spark</li><li>Apply suitable analytic approaches for text, graph, and time series data</li><li>Interpret the terminology that you will encounter in technical papers</li><li>Import libraries from other JVM languages such as Java and Scala</li><li>Communicate your findings clearly and convincingly to nontechnical colleagues</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>The term ?data science? has been widely used to define this new profession that is expected to interpret vast datasets and translate them to improved decision-making and performance. Clojure is a powerful language that combines the interactivity of a scripting language with the speed of a compiled language. Together with its rich ecosystem of native libraries and an extremely simple and consistent functional approach to data manipulation, which maps closely to mathematical formula, it is an ideal, practical, and flexible language to meet a data scientist's diverse needs.</p><p>Taking you on a journey from simple summary statistics to sophisticated machine learning algorithms, this book shows how the Clojure programming language can be used to derive insights from data. Data scientists often forge a novel path, and you'll see how to make use of Clojure's Java interoperability capabilities to access libraries such as Mahout and Mllib for which Clojure wrappers don't yet exist. Even seasoned Clojure developers will develop a deeper appreciation for their language's flexibility!</p><p>You'll learn how to apply statistical thinking to your own data and use Clojure to explore, analyze, and visualize it in a technically and statistically robust way. You can also use Incanter for local data processing and ClojureScript to present interactive visualisations and understand how distributed platforms such as Hadoop sand Spark's MapReduce and GraphX's BSP solve the challenges of data analysis at scale, and how to explain algorithms using those programming models.</p><p>Above all, by following the explanations in this book, you'll learn not just how to be effective using the current state-of-the-art methods in data science, but why such methods work so that you can continue to be productive as the field evolves into the future.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This is a practical guide to data science that teaches theory by example through the libraries and frameworks accessible from the Clojure programming language.</p></span>",

It's not just spouting some party line.\"-Rob Church, a developer of MediaWiki<br/><br/>MediaWiki is the world's most popular wiki platform, the software that runs Wikipedia and thousands of other websites. Though it appears simple to use at first glance, MediaWiki has extraordinarily powerful and deep capabilities for managing and organizing knowledge. In corporate environments, MediaWiki can transform the way teams write and collaborate.<br/><br/>This comprehensive book covers MediaWiki's rich (and sometimes subtle) features, helping you become a wiki expert in no time. You'll learn how to:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>Find your way around by effective searching and browsing</li><li>Create and edit articles, categories, and user preferences</li><li>Use advanced features for authors, such as templates, dynamic lists, logical parser functions, and RSS, to organize and maintain large numbers of articles</li><li>Install and run your own wiki, and configure its look and behavior</li><li>Develop custom wiki features, called extensions, with the PHP programming language and MySQL database</li></ul><p>This book also provides special guidance for creating successful corporate wikis. For beginners who want to create or work on collaborative, community-driven websites with this platform, <em>MediaWiki</em> is the essential one-stop guide.<br/><br/>\"I was a MediaWiki newbie before reading this book.

You'll explore various features of Kotlin by building three applications of varying complexity. For a quick start to Android development, we look at building a classic game, Tetris, and elaborate on object-oriented programming in Kotlin. Our next application will be a messenger app, a level up in terms of complexity. Before moving onto the third app, we take a look at data persistent methods, helping us learn about the storage and retrieval of useful applications. Our final app is a place reviewer: a web application that will make use of the Google Maps API and Place Picker.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will have gained experience of of creating and deploying Android applications using Kotlin.</p><p><b>Style and Approach</b></p><p>Here we will build three exciting projects in Kotlin which will demonstrate how to effectively use Kotlin language constructs </p></span>",

Groovy preserves the Java semantics and extends the JDK  to give you true dynamic language capabilities.  <i>Programming Groovy 2</i> will help you, the experienced Java developer, learn and take advantage of the latest version of  this rich dynamic language. You'll go from the basics of Groovy to the latest advances in the language, including options for type checking, tail-call and memoization optimizations, compile time metaprogramming, and fluent interfaces to  create DSLs. <br/><br/>You don't have to leave the rich Java Platform to take advantage of Groovy. Groovy preserves Java's semantics and extends the JDK, so programming in Groovy feels like the Java language has been augmented; it's like working with a lighter, more elegant Java. If you're an experienced Java developer who wants to learn how Groovy works, you'll find exactly what you need in this book.<br/><br/>You'll start with the fundamentals of programming in Groovy and how it works with Java, and then you'll explore advanced concepts such as unit testing with mock objects, using Builders, working with databases and XML, and creating DSLs. You'll master Groovy's powerful yet complex run-time and compile-time metaprogramming features.<br/><br/>Much has evolved in the Groovy language since the publication of the first edition of <i>Programming Groovy</i>. <i>Programming Groovy 2</i> will help you learn and apply Groovy's new features.  Creating DSLs is easier now, and Groovy's already-powerful metaprogramming facilities have improved even more. You'll see how to work with closures, including tail call optimization and memoization. The book also covers Groovy's new static compilation feature.<br/><br/>Whether you're learning the basics of the language or interested in getting proficient with the new features, <i>Programming Groovy 2</i> has you covered.<br/><br/><b>What You Need</b><br/><br/>To work on the examples in the book you need Groovy 2.0.5 and Java JDK 5 or higher.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Level up your skills by taking advantage of Clojure's powerful macro system. Macros make hard things possible and normal things easy. They can be tricky to use, and this book will help you deftly navigate the terrain. You'll discover how to write straightforward code that avoids duplication and clarifies your intentions. You'll learn how and why to write macros. You'll learn to recognize situations when using a macro would (and wouldn't!) be helpful.  And you'll use macros to remove unnecessary code and build new language features.<br/><br/>Clojure offers some sharp tools in its toolbox, and one of the sharpest is its macro system. This book will help you write macros using Clojure, and more importantly, recognize when you should be using macros in the first place.<br/><br/>The Lisp \"code-as-data\" philosophy gives tremendous advantages to macro authors and users. You can use macros to evaluate code in other contexts, move computations to compile time, and create beautiful API layers. You don't need to wait on the Clojure language itself to add new features, you'll learn how to implement even the lowest-level features as macros. You'll step through representative samples of how to use macros in production libraries and applications, find clear details on how to construct macros, and learn pointers to avoid obstacles that often trip up macro amateurs.<br/><br/>Clojure macros are more straightforward to use than metaprogramming features in many other languages, but they're different enough from normal programming to present challenges of their own. <i>Mastering Clojure Macros</i> examines some of these issues, along with alternatives to macros where they exist.<br/><br/>By the time you finish this book, you'll be thinking like a macro professional.<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b>The book examples have been developed under Clojure 1.6.0, although earlier and later versions of Clojure may work as well. You'll want to use Leiningen 2.x in order to follow along with the examples that use external projects.</p></span>",

You can pick up and read this book and build an\nindustry-standard system in a weekend: It has everything you need\nto get started with a new project. I also found it helpful in\nreviewing the structure of existing projects.”\n<em>—Timothy Pratley,\ndeveloper</em> \n</p><p>Developers are discovering the exceptional\npower of Clojure’s functional programming model to quickly\nsolve problems in domains ranging from social networking to Big\nData. Clojure is fast and efficient—ideal for rapid\nprototyping and lean development. And it is highly expressive and\nextremely extensible, which makes Clojure one of today’s\nleading tools for software innovation. Since it targets the Java\nVirtual Machine, Clojure also leverages the Java platform’s\nmaturity and enormous ecosystem.</p><p><b><em><b>Clojure Recipes</b></em></b> is a\nwide-ranging, up-to-date “code recipe book” for this\nincreasingly popular language. With practical and self-contained\nexamples, author Julian Gamble illuminates Clojure’s key\nfeatures and best practices, showing how to solve real-world\nproblems one step at a time. Focusing on Clojure 1.7 and higher,\nGamble fully reflects recent enhancements that ensure you’re\ngetting the most up-to-date code for your project.</p><p>Gamble first walks you through the essential\nsteps required to set up your Clojure development environment, from\nsetting up the Leiningen build tool to packaging Clojure for Java\nEE environments. He then shows you how to build both basic and\nadvanced REST servers, before turning to a wide range of\nincreasingly sophisticated applications.</p><p>In this book you will find</p><li><p>\nInnovative Clojure code for diverse web,\nsecurity, administration, and development tasks, from log reading\nand app monitoring to software testing\n</p></li><li><p>\nDetailed instructions for using\nconcurrency primitives, writing new DSLs, simplifying cloud\ndatabase development, and more\n</p></li><li><p>\n“Learn by doing” projects,\nwhich offer practical experience with Clojurescript, Storm,\nPedestal, Datomic, and other advanced tools\n</p></li><li><p>\nCoverage of using Clojure with Cascalog\n2.0 to write complex Hadoop queries with minimal code \n</p></li><p>The breadth and quality of Gamble’s\nexamples make <b><em><b>Clojure Recipes</b></em></b> uniquely\nvaluable both to developers who are exploring Clojure for the first\ntime and to those already using it in production.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "AspectJ Cookbook",
			"description": "<span><p>When Object Oriented programming (OO) first appeared, it was a revelation. OO gave developers the ability to create software that was more flexible and robust, but as time went on and applications became more sophisticated, too, certain areas of \"traditional\" OO architectures were found wanting. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) addresses those issues by extending the OO approach even further.Many developers are interested in AOP--especially in AspectJ, the open source extension of the Java programming language that explicitly supports the AOP approach. Yet, although AspectJ is included with Eclipse, the increasingly popular open source IDE for Java, finding a practical and non-theoretical way to learn this language and other AOP tools and techniques has been a real problem.Until now. The <i>AspectJ Cookbook</i> offers a hands-on solution--in fact, several--with a wide variety of code recipes for solving day-to-day design and coding problems using AOP's unique approach.AOP allows the global properties of a program to determine how it's compiled into an executable program. Before AOP, important program design decisions were difficult to capture in actual code. Instead, the implementation of those design decisions--known as \"aspects\"--were scattered throughout, resulting in \"tangled\" code that was hard to develop and maintain. AOP has been compared to the manufacturing of cloth, in which threads are automatically interwoven. Without AOP, programmers must stitch the threads by hand.The <i>AspectJ Cookbook</i> shows readers why, and how, common Java development problems can be solved by using AOP techniques. With our popular problem-solution-discussion format, the book presents real world examples to demonstrate that AOP is more than just a concept; it's a development process that will benefit users in an immediate and visible manner.If you're interested in how AOP is changing the way software is developed, and how you can use AspectJ to make code more modular, easier to develop, maintain, evolve and deploy, this is the book that really delivers.</p></span>",

It focuses on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs, which are intended to facilitate the development of more robust programs, particularly multithreaded ones. It is built with performance, pragmatism, and simplicity in mind. Like most general purpose languages, various Clojure features have different performance characteristics that one should know in order to write high performance code.</p><p>This book shows you how to evaluate the performance implications of various Clojure abstractions, discover their underpinnings, and apply the right approach for optimum performance in real-world programs.</p><p>It starts by helping you classify various use cases and the need for them with respect to performance and analysis of various performance aspects. You will also learn the performance vocabulary that experts use throughout the world and discover various Clojure data structures, abstractions, and their performance characteristics. Further, the book will guide you through enhancing performance by using Java interoperability and JVM-specific features from Clojure. It also highlights the importance of using the right concurrent data structure and Java concurrency abstractions.</p><p>This book also sheds light on performance metrics for measuring, how to measure, and how to visualize and monitor the collected data. At the end of the book, you will learn to run a performance profiler, identify bottlenecks, tune performance, and refactor code to get a better performance.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>An easy-to-follow guide full of real-world examples and self-sufficient code snippets that will help you get your hands dirty with high performance programming with Clojure.</p></span>",

Groovy has much in common with popular scripting languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby, but is written in a Java-like syntax. And, unlike these other languages, Groovy is sanctioned by the Java community for use on the Java platform. Since it is based on Java, applications written in Groovy can make full use of the Java Application Programmer Interfaces (APIs). This means Groovy can integrate seamlessly with applications written in Java, while avoiding the complexities of the full Java language. This bare-bones structure also means Groovy can be used as an introduction to Java and to programming in general. Its simpler constructions and modern origins make it ideal as a first language and for introducing principles such as object-oriented programming.<br/>This book introduces all the major aspects of Groovy development and emphasizes Groovy's potential as a learning tool. Case studies and exercises are included, along with numerous programming examples. The book begins assuming only a general familiarity with Java programming, and progresses to discuss advanced topics such as GUI builders, Groovlets, Unit Testing, and Groovy SQL.<ul><li>The first comprehensive book on Groovy programming that shows how writing applications and scripts for the Java platform is fast and easy</li><li>Written by leading software engineers and acclaimed computing instructors</li><li>Offers numerous programming examples, code samples, detailed case studies, exercises for self-study, and a companion website with a Windows-based Groovy editor</li></ul>\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>NOTE: This book contains information about technologies that\nhave been superseded and it is retained for historical purposes\nonly.</p><p>IBM CICS Transaction Server (CICS TS) has supported the\ndeployment of Java applications since the 1990’s. In CICS TS\nV1.3 (1999), IBM introduced the 'Pooled JVM' style of JVM\ninfrastructure within CICS TS. This infrastructure was designed to\nbe similar in nature to that which a CICS application developer for\na language such as COBOL would be used to. It brought the benefits\nof the new Java language to CICS TS, without a dramatic change to\nthe way CICS users thought of core concepts such as re-entrancy and\nisolation.</p><p>As enterprise usage of Java evolved it began to make more and\nmore use of multi-threaded environments where isolation was not a\ndesired characteristic. Additionally, technologies such as OSGi\n(Open Service Gateway Initiative) evolved to overcome some of the\noriginal disadvantages of applying Java to an enterprise\nenvironment. As such, the limitations of the 'Pooled JVM' approach\nbegan to outweigh the benefits.</p><p>In CICS TS V4.1 (2009), IBM introduced the new 'JVM server'\ninfrastructure in CICS TS as a replacement to the 'Pooled JVM'\napproach. This 'JVM server' infrastructure provides a much more\nstandard Java environment that makes the writing and porting of\nJava applications for CICS TS much simpler.</p><p>In CICS TS V5.1 (2012), support for the old 'Pooled JVM'\ninfrastructure was removed. While there is a relatively simple\nmigration path from 'Pooled JVM' to 'JVM server', applications\nshould no longer be written to the 'Pooled JVM' infrastructure.\nThere are a number of more recent IBM Redbooks publications\ncovering the replacement 'JVM server' technology,\nincluding:<br/></p><li><p>IBM CICS and the JVM server: Developing and Deploying Java\nApplications, SG24-8038<br/></p></li><li><p>A Software Architect’s guide to New Java Workloads in IBM\nCICS Transaction Server, SG24-8225[<br/></p></li></span></span>",

			"title": "Beginning Groovy, Grails and Griffon",
			"description": "<span><span><p>Web frameworks are playing a major role in the creation of today's most compelling web applications, because they automate many of the tedious tasks, allowing developers to instead focus on providing users with creative and powerful features. Java developers have been particularly fortunate in this area, having been able to take advantage of Grails, an open source framework that supercharges productivity when building Java–driven web sites. Grails is based on Groovy, which is a very popular and growing dynamic scripting language for Java developers and was inspired by Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk.</p><p><em>Beginning Groovy, Grails and Griffon</em> is the first introductory book on the Groovy language and its primary web framework, Grails. Griffon is also covered. While Grails is the Web framework for building Groovy Web applications, Griffon is the deskop framework for building desktop Groovy applications. Could Groovy be the new Java? It's light, fast and free (open source).</p><p>This book gets you started with Groovy, Grails and Griffon, and culminates in the example and possible application of some real–world projects. You follow along with the development of each project, implementing and running each application while learning new features along the way.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>Understand the fundamentals of the open source, dynamic Groovy scripting language and the Grails web framework.</p></li><li><p>Capitalize upon Grails' well–defined framework architecture to build web applications faster than ever before.</p></li><li><p>Improve your web application with cutting–edge interface enhancements using Ajax.</p></li><li><p>Use Grails' object–relational mapping solution, GORM, to manage your data store more effectively than ever before.</p></li><li><p>Take advantage of Groovy to create reporting services, implement batch processing, and create alternative client interfaces.</p></li><li><p>Deploy and upgrade your Grails–driven applications with expertise and ease.</p></li><li><p>Discover an alternative client in Groovy as well.</p></li><li><p>Explore the Griffon framework for creating Groovy-based desktop applications.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>Java and web developers looking to learn and embrace the power and flexibility offered by the more agile, lightweight Groovy scripting language and its Grails and Griffon frameworks.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>The rise of Ruby on Rails has signified a huge shift in how we build web applications today; it is a fantastic framework with a growing community. There is, however, space for another such framework that integrates seamlessly with Java. Thousands of companies have invested in Java, and these same companies are losing out on the benefits of a Rails–like framework. Enter Grails.</p><p>Grails is not just a Rails clone. It aims to provide a Rails–like environment that is more familiar to Java developers and employs idioms that Java developers are comfortable using, making the adjustment in mentality to a dynamic framework less of a jump. The concepts within Grails, like interceptors, tag libs, and Groovy Server Pages (GSP), make those in the Java community feel right at home.</p><p>Grails' foundation is on solid open source technologies such as Spring, Hibernate, and SiteMesh, which gives it even more potential in the Java space: Spring provides powerful inversion of control and MVC, Hibernate brings a stable, mature object relational mapping technology with the ability to integrate with legacy systems, and SiteMesh handles flexible layout control and page decoration.</p><p>Grails complements these with additional features that take advantage of the coding–by–convention paradigm such as dynamic tag libraries, Grails object relational mapping, Groovy Server Pages, and scaffolding.</p><p><b>Graeme Rocher</b>, Grails lead and founder, and <b>Jeff Brown</b> bring you completely up–to–date with their authoritative and fully comprehensive guide to the Grails framework. You'll get to know all the core features, services, and Grails extensions via plug–ins, and understand the roles that Groovy and Grails are playing in the changing Web.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><ul><li><p>Discover how the Web is changing and the role the Groovy language and its Rails framework play</p></li><li><p>Get to know the Grails Project and its domains, services, filters, controllers, views, testing, and plug–ins </p></li><li><p>Experience the availability of plug–ins for Rich Client and Ajax, web services, performance/utilities, scheduling, security, functionality, and even Persistence</p></li><li><p>See how Grails works with other frameworks like Spring, Wicket, Hibernate, and more </p></li><li><p>Create custom plug–ins in Grails </p></li></ul><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for everyone who is looking for a more agile approach to web development with a dynamic scripting language such as Groovy. This includes a large number of Java developers who have been enticed by the productivity gains seen with frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, JRuby on Rails, etc. The Web and its environment is a perfect fit for easily adaptable and concise languages such as Groovy and Ruby, and there is huge interest from the developer community in general to embrace these languages.</p></span></span></span>",
