While there are plenty of tutorials available that teach Go's syntax to developers with experience in other programming languages, tutorials aren't enough.

			"title": "The Go Programming Language",
			"description": "<span><p><i><b>The Go Programming Language</b></i> is the authoritative resource for any programmer who wants to learn Go. It shows how to write clear and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems. The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with any specific language, so you'll find it accessible whether you're most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++.</p><p>Â </p><ul><li><div>The first chapter is a tutorial on the basic concepts of Go, introduced through programs for file I/O and text processing, simple graphics, and web clients and servers.</div></li><li><div>Early chapters cover the structural elements of Go programs: syntax, control flow, data types, and the organization of a program into packages, files, and functions. The examples illustrate many packages from the standard library and show how to create new ones of your own. Later chapters explain the package mechanism in more detail, and how to build, test, and maintain projects using the go tool.</div></li><li><div>The chapters on methods and interfaces introduce Go's unconventional approach to object-oriented programming, in which methods can be declared on any type and interfaces are implicitly satisfied. They explain the key principles of encapsulation, composition, and substitutability using realistic examples.</div></li><li><div>Two chapters on concurrency present in-depth approaches to this increasingly important topic. The first, which covers the basic mechanisms of goroutines and channels, illustrates the style known as communicating sequential processes for which Go is renowned. The second covers more traditional aspects of concurrency with shared variables. These chapters provide a solid foundation for programmers encountering concurrency for the first time.</div></li><li><div>The final two chapters explore lower-level features of Go. One covers the art of metaprogramming using reflection. The other shows how to use the unsafe package to step outside the type system for special situations, and how to use the cgo tool to create Go bindings for C libraries.</div></li></ul><p>The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of well-written Go code that cover the whole language, its most important packages, and a wide range of applications. Each chapter has exercises to test your understanding and explore extensions and alternatives. Source code is freely available for download from <a href=\"http://gopl.io/\">http://gopl.io/</a> and may be conveniently fetched, built, and installed using the go get command.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Whether you want to automate tasks, analyze data, parse logs, talk to network services, or address other systems requirements, writing your own command-line tool may be the fastest - and perhaps the most fun - way to do it. The Go programming language is a great choice for developing tools that are fast, reliable, and cross-platform. Create command-line tools that work with files, connect to services, and even manage external processes, all while using tests and benchmarks to ensure your programs are fast and correct.</p><p>When you want to develop cross platform command-line tools that are fast and reliable, use Go, a modern programming language that combines the reliability of compiled languages with the ease of use and flexibility of dynamic typed languages. Work through practical examples to develop elegant and efficient tools by applying Go's rich standard library, its built in support for concurrency, and its expressive syntax. Use Go's integrated testing capabilities to automatically test your tools, ensuring they work reliably even across code refactoring.</p><p>Develop CLI tools that interact with your users by using common input/output patterns, including environment variables and flags. Handle files to read or persist data, and manipulate paths consistently in cross-platform scenarios. Control processes and handle signals, and use a benchmark driven approach and Go's concurrency primitives to create tools that perform well. Use powerful external libraries such as Cobra to create modern and flexible tools that handle subcommands, and develop tools that interact with databases, APIs, and network services. Finally, leverage what you learned by tackling additional challenges at the end of each chapter.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>Go 1.8 or higher, an internet connection to download the example files and additional libraries, and a text editor to write your programs.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>Your one-stop guide to the common patterns and practices, showing you how to apply these using the Go programming language</b></p><p><b>About This Book</b></p><ul><li>This short, concise, and practical guide is packed with real-world examples of building microservices with Go</li><li>It is easy to read and will benefit smaller teams who want to extend the functionality of their existing systems</li><li>Using this practical approach will save your money in terms of maintaining a monolithic architecture and demonstrate capabilities in ease of use</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>You should have a working knowledge of programming in Go, including writing and compiling basic applications. However, no knowledge of RESTful architecture, microservices, or web services is expected. If you are looking to apply techniques to your own projects, taking your first steps into microservice architecture, this book is for you.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Plan a microservice architecture and design a microservice</li><li>Write a microservice with a RESTful API and a database</li><li>Understand the common idioms and common patterns in microservices architecture</li><li>Leverage tools and automation that helps microservices become horizontally scalable</li><li>Get a grounding in containerization with Docker and Docker-Compose, which will greatly accelerate your development lifecycle</li><li>Manage and secure Microservices at scale with monitoring, logging, service discovery, and automation</li><li>Test microservices and integrate API tests in Go</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Microservice architecture is sweeping the world as the de facto pattern to build web-based applications. Golang is a language particularly well suited to building them. Its strong community, encouragement of idiomatic style, and statically-linked binary artifacts make integrating it with other technologies and managing microservices at scale consistent and intuitive. This book will teach you the common patterns and practices, showing you how to apply these using the Go programming language.</p><p>It will teach you the fundamental concepts of architectural design and RESTful communication, and show you patterns that provide manageable code that is supportable in development and at scale in production. We will provide you with examples on how to put these concepts and patterns into practice with Go.</p><p>Whether you are planning a new application or working in an existing monolith, this book will explain and illustrate with practical examples how teams of all sizes can start solving problems with microservices. It will help you understand Docker and Docker-Compose and how it can be used to isolate microservice dependencies and build environments. We finish off by showing you various techniques to monitor, test, and secure your microservices.</p><p>By the end, you will know the benefits of system resilience of a microservice and the advantages of Go stack.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>The step-by-step tutorial focuses on building microservices. Each chapter expands upon the previous one, teaching you the main skills and techniques required to be a successful microservice practitioner.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

Most Go applications these days will run in a data center or on the cloud, which is a condition upon which the next chapter depends. There, you'll expand your skills considerably by writing a distributed document indexing system during the next two chapters. This system has to balance a large corpus of documents with considerable analytical demands. </p><p>Another use case is the way in which a web application written in Go can be consciously redesigned to take distributed features into account. The chapter is rather interesting for Go developers who have to migrate existing Go applications to computationally and memory-intensive environments. The final chapter relates to the rather onerous task of testing parallel and distributed applications, something that is not usually taught in standard computer science curricula.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>Distributed Computing with Go takes you through a series of carefully graded tutorials, building ever more sophisticated applications.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>\"What Went Wrong?\" has revolutionized the way industry views safety. <br/><br/>The new edition continues and extends the wisdom, innovations and strategies of previous editions, by introducing new material on recent incidents, and adding an extensive new section that shows how many accidents occur through simple miscommunications within the organization, and how strightforward changes in design can often remove or reduce opportunities for human errors. <br/><br/>Kletz' approach to learning as deeply as possible from previous experiences is made yet more valuable in this new edtion, which for the first time brings together the approaches and cases of \"What Went Wrong\" with the managerially focussed material previously published in \"Still Going Wrong\". Updated and supplemented with new cases and analysis, this fifth edition is the ultimate resource of experienced based anaylsis and guidance for the safety and loss prevention professionals.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>* A million dollar bestseller, this trusted book is updated with new material, including the Texas City and Buncefield incidents, and supplemented by material from Trevor Kletz's 'Still Going Wrong'<br/>* Now presents a complete analysis of the design, operational and for the first time, managerial causes of process plant accidents and disasters, plus their aftermaths<br/>* Case histories illustrate what went wrong, why it went wrong, and then guide readers in how to avoid similar tragedies: learn from the mistakes of others</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Dockerâs catchphrase for its containers is compelling: \"Build, Ship and Run Any App, Anywhere.\" Go already has some of those attributes built in, including cross-compilation and the production of single executable files without dependencies. Are there any reasons, then, for Go programmers to use containers to deploy code?</p><p>In this lesson, veteran developer Liz Rice outlines several advantages that containers can provide for Go programmersâsuch as how they help you restrict the resources that your code can access, and how you can use them to run and test your software locally with other components. Youâll then look at some cases where containers wouldnât add any benefit at all.</p><p>As always, itâs important to use the right tool for the job, and containers can offer advantages for Go programmers in the right circumstances. This lesson provides some helpful guidelines.</p></div></span>",

It's clear and easy to read, with loads of examples that showed my students what to do.\"</p><p>-- Larry Snyder, Emeritus Professor, University of Washington, Department of Computer Science and Engineering</p><p>\"Having the TouchDevelop book available made our events so much easier. Students could figure things out for themselves with help from the book.\"</p><p>-- Jennifer Marsman, Microsoft Principal Developer Evangelist</p><p>Mobiledevices such as smartphones and tablets are set to become the main computersthat virtually all people will own and carry with them at all times. And yet,mobile devices are not yet used for all computing tasks. A project at MicrosoftResearch was created to answer a simple question: \"It is possible to createinteresting apps directly on a smartphone or tablet, without using a separatePC or a keyboard?\" The result is TouchDevelop, a programming environment thatruns on all modern mobile devices such as Windows Phone, iPhone, iPad, Androidphones and tablets, and also on PCs and Macs.</p><p>This book walks you through all of the screens of the TouchDevelop app, and itpoints out similarities and differences of the TouchDevelop language comparedto other programming languages. For users, the book can serve as a handyreference next to the phone. The book systematically addresses all programminglanguage constructs, starting from the very basic constructs such as variablesand loops. The book also explores many of the phone sensors and data sourceswhich make creating apps for mobile devices so rewarding.</p><p>If you are new to programming with TouchDevelop, or if you have not yet workedon touchscreen devices, we suggest that you read the book starting from Chapter1. If you are already familiar with the basic paradigm of the TouchDevelopprogramming environment, then feel free to jump ahead to the later chaptersthat address particular topic areas.</p><p>This book is written from theperspective of a person developing their code using a web browser. TheTouchDevelop Web App runs in many modern browsers on many different devicesincluding smartphones and tablets, Macs, PC. All screenshots and navigationinstructions refer to the TouchDevelop Web App running in a browser. ForWindows Phone, there is a dedicated TouchDevelop app in the Windows Phone Storewhich gives access to many more sensors and data sources. Starting with theTouchDevelop app v3.0 for Windows Phone 8, the phone app will share the samelook and navigation structure and all features of the Web App.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>The little tricks to programming on your mobile devices and for a mobile device</p></li><li><p>The scripting language and cloud-based ecosystem</p></li><li><p>Using cameras, video and audio, and other sensors such as a microphone, accelerometer, compass, and gyroscope</p></li><li><p>Access to the web, authorized access to web services</p></li><li><p>How to write simple games using a built-in physics engine</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This programming language was written for people who wish tobe able to create apps from their phone.
