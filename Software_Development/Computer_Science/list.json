			"description": "<span><span><p>This book introduces the mathematics that\nsupports advanced computer programming and the analysis of\nalgorithms. The primary aim of its well-known authors is to provide\na solid and relevant base of mathematical skills - the skills\nneeded to solve complex problems, to evaluate horrendous sums, and\nto discover subtle patterns in data. It is an indispensable text\nand reference not only for computer scientists - the authors\nthemselves rely heavily on it! - but for serious users of\nmathematics in virtually every discipline.</p><p>Concrete Mathematics is a blending of\nCONtinuous and disCRETE mathematics. \"More concretely,\" the authors\nexplain, \"it is the controlled manipulation of mathematical\nformulas, using a collection of techniques for solving problems.\"\nThe subject matter is primarily an expansion of the Mathematical\nPreliminaries section in Knuth's classic Art of Computer\nProgramming, but the style of presentation is more leisurely, and\nindividual topics are covered more deeply. Several new topics have\nbeen added, and the most significant ideas have been traced to\ntheir historical roots. The book includes more than 500 exercises,\ndivided into six categories. Complete answers are provided for all\nexercises, except research problems, making the book particularly\nvaluable for self-study.</p><p>Major topics include:</p><li><p>Sums</p></li><li><p>Recurrences</p></li><li><p>Integer functions</p></li><li><p>Elementary number theory</p></li><li><p>Binomial coefficients</p></li><li><p>Generating functions</p></li><li><p>Discrete probability</p></li><li><p>Asymptotic methods</p></li><p>This second edition includes important new\nmaterial about mechanical summation. In response to the widespread\nuse of the first edition as a reference book, the bibliography and\nindex have also been expanded, and additional nontrivial\nimprovements can be found on almost every page. Readers will\nappreciate the informal style of Concrete Mathematics. Particularly\nenjoyable are the marginal graffiti contributed by students who\nhave taken courses based on this material. The authors want to\nconvey not only the importance of the techniques presented, but\nsome of the fun in learning and using them.</p></span></span>",

It is being used quite widely in different spheres of technology, including cybersecurity, finance, and many more, but its concepts, such as superposition, are often misunderstood because engineers may not know the math to understand them. This book will teach the requisite math concepts in an intuitive way and connect them to principles in quantum computing.</p><p>Starting with the most basic of concepts, 2D vectors that are just line segments in space, you'll move on to tackle matrix multiplication using an instinctive method. Linearity is the major theme throughout the book and since quantum mechanics is a linear theory, you'll see how they go hand in hand. As you advance, you'll understand intrinsically what a vector is and how to transform vectors with matrices and operators. You'll also see how complex numbers make their voices heard and understand the probability behind it all.</p><p>It's all here, in writing you can understand. This is not a stuffy math book with definitions, axioms, theorems, and so on. This book meets you where you're at and guides you to where you need to be for quantum computing. Already know some of this stuff? No problem! The book is componentized, so you can learn just the parts you want. And with tons of exercises and their answers, you'll get all the practice you need.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Operate on vectors (qubits) with matrices (gates)</li><li>Define linear combinations and linear independence</li><li>Understand vector spaces and their basis sets</li><li>Rotate, reflect, and project vectors with matrices</li><li>Realize the connection between complex numbers and the Bloch sphere</li><li>Determine whether a matrix is invertible and find its eigenvalues</li><li>Probabilistically determine the measurement of a qubit</li><li>Tie it all together with bra-ket notation</li></ul><h4>Who this book is for</h4><p>If you want to learn quantum computing but are unsure of the math involved, this book is for you. If you've taken high school math, you'll easily understand the topics covered. And even if you haven't, the book will give you a refresher on topics such as trigonometry, matrices, and vectors.

Despite the importance of recursion for algorithm design, most programming books do not cover the topic in detail, despite the fact that numerous computer programming professors and researchers in the field of computer science education agree that recursion is difficult for novice students. </p><p></p><b>\n</b><p>Introduction to Recursive Programming provides a detailed and comprehensive introduction to recursion. This text will serve as a useful guide for anyone who wants to learn how to think and program recursively, by analyzing a wide variety of computational problems of diverse difficulty.</p><p></p><p>It contains specific chapters on the most common types of recursion (linear, tail, and multiple), as well as on algorithm design paradigms in which recursion is prevalent (divide and conquer, and backtracking). Therefore, it can be used in introductory programming courses, and in more advanced classes on algorithm design. The book also covers lower-level topics related to iteration and program execution, and includes a rich chapter on the theoretical analysis of the computational cost of recursive programs, offering readers the possibility to learn some basic mathematics along the way.</p><p></p><p>It also incorporates several elements aimed at helping students master the material. First, it contains a larger collection of simple problems in order to provide a solid foundation of the core concepts, before diving into more complex material. In addition, one of the book's main assets is the use of a step-by-step methodology, together with specially designed diagrams, for guiding and illustrating the process of developing recursive algorithms. Furthermore, the book covers combinatorial problems and mutual recursion. These topics can broaden students' understanding of recursion by forcing them to apply the learned concepts differently, or in a more sophisticated manner.</p><p></p><p>The code examples have been written in Python 3, but should be straightforward to understand for students with experience in other programming languages. Finally, worked out solutions to over 120 end-of-chapter exercises are available for instructors. </p><p></p><p> </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><i>Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist: Effective Modeling in RDFS and OWL, Second Edition</i>, discusses the capabilities of Semantic Web modeling languages, such as RDFS (Resource Description Framework Schema) and OWL (Web Ontology Language). Organized into 16 chapters, the book provides examples to illustrate the use of Semantic Web technologies in solving common modeling problems. It uses the life and works of William Shakespeare to demonstrate some of the most basic capabilities of the Semantic Web. The book first provides an overview of the Semantic Web and aspects of the Web. It then discusses semantic modeling and how it can support the development from chaotic information gathering to one characterized by information sharing, cooperation, and collaboration. It also explains the use of RDF to implement the Semantic Web by allowing information to be distributed over the Web, along with the use of SPARQL to access RDF data. Moreover, the reader is introduced to components that make up a Semantic Web deployment and how they fit together, the concept of inferencing in the Semantic Web, and how RDFS differs from other schema languages. Finally, the book considers the use of SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) to manage vocabularies by taking advantage of the inferencing structure of RDFS-Plus. This book is intended for the working ontologist who is trying to create a domain model on the Semantic Web.<ul><li>Updated with the latest developments and advances in Semantic Web technologies for organizing, querying, and processing information, including SPARQL, RDF and RDFS, OWL 2.0, and SKOS </li><li>Detailed information on the ontologies used in today's key web applications, including ecommerce, social networking, data mining, using government data, and more </li><li>Even more illustrative examples and case studies that demonstrate what semantic technologies are and how they work together to solve real-world problems</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Named a Notable Book in the 21st Annual Best of Computing list by the ACM!</p><p>Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne’s <strong><em>Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach</em></strong> is the ideal modern introduction to computer science with Java programming for both students and professionals. Taking a broad, applications-based approach, Sedgewick and Wayne teach through important examples from science, mathematics, engineering, finance, and commercial computing.</p><p>The book demystifies computation, explains its intellectual underpinnings, and covers the essential elements of programming and computational problem solving in today’s environments. The authors begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and I/O. Next, they turn to functions, introducing key modular programming concepts, including components and reuse. They present a modern introduction to object-oriented programming, covering current programming paradigms and approaches to data abstraction.</p><p>Building on this foundation, Sedgewick and Wayne widen their focus to the broader discipline of computer science.

			"description": "<span><p>In <i>Distributed Algorithms</i>, Nancy Lynch provides a blueprint for designing, implementing, and analyzing distributed algorithms.  She directs her book at a wide audience, including students, programmers, system designers, and researchers.</p><br/><br/><p><i>Distributed Algorithms</i> contains the most significant algorithms and impossibility results in the area, all in a simple automata-theoretic setting.  The algorithms are proved correct, and their complexity is analyzed according to precisely defined complexity measures.  The problems covered include resource allocation, communication, consensus among distributed processes, data consistency, deadlock detection, leader election, global snapshots, and many others.</p><br/><br/><p>The material is organized according to the system model—first by the timing model and then by the interprocess communication mechanism.  The material on system models is isolated in separate chapters for easy reference.</p><br/><br/><p>The presentation is completely rigorous, yet is intuitive enough for immediate comprehension.  This book familiarizes readers with important problems, algorithms, and impossibility results in the area: readers can then recognize the problems when they arise in practice, apply the algorithms to solve them, and use the impossibility results to determine whether problems are unsolvable.  The book also provides readers with the basic mathematical tools for designing new algorithms and proving new impossibility results.  In addition, it teaches readers how to reason carefully about distributed algorithms—to model them formally, devise precise specifications for their required behavior, prove their correctness, and evaluate their performance with realistic measures.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><br/><p><br/><i>Pyramid Algorithms</i> presents a unique approach to understanding, analyzing, and computing the most common polynomial and spline curve and surface schemes used in computer-aided geometric design, employing a dynamic programming method based on recursive pyramids.<br/>The recursive pyramid approach offers the distinct advantage of revealing the entire structure of algorithms, as well as relationships between them, at a glance.  This book-the only one built around this approach-is certain to change the way you think about CAGD and the way you perform it, and all it requires is a basic background in calculus and linear algebra, and simple programming skills.<br/><br/>* Written by one of the world's most eminent CAGD researchers<br/>* Designed for use as both a professional reference and a textbook, and addressed to computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, theoreticians, and students alike<br/>* Includes chapters on Bezier curves and surfaces, B-splines, blossoming, and multi-sided Bezier patches<br/>* Relies on an easily understood notation, and concludes each section with both practical and theoretical exercises that enhance and elaborate upon the discussion in the text<br/>* Foreword by Professor Helmut Pottmann, Vienna University of Technology</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Unlock the secrets to creating random mazes! Whether you're a game developer, an algorithm connoisseur, or simply in search of a new puzzle, you're about to level up. Learn algorithms to randomly generate mazes in a variety of shapes, sizes, and dimensions. Bend them into Moebius strips, fold them into cubes, and wrap them around spheres. Stretch them into other dimensions, squeeze them into arbitrary outlines, and tile them in a dizzying variety of ways. From twelve little algorithms, you'll discover a vast reservoir of ideas and inspiration.<br/><br/>From video games to movies, mazes are ubiquitous. Explore a dozen algorithms for generating these puzzles randomly, from Binary Tree to Eller's, each copiously illustrated and accompanied by working implementations in Ruby. You'll learn their pros and cons, and how to choose the right one for the job.<br/><br/>You'll start by learning six maze algorithms and transition from making mazes on paper to writing programs that generate and draw them. You'll be introduced to Dijkstra's algorithm and see how it can help solve, analyze, and visualize mazes. Part 2 shows you how to constrain your mazes to different shapes and outlines, such as text, circles, hex and triangle grids, and more. You'll learn techniques for culling dead-ends, and for making your passages weave over and under each other. Part 3 looks at six more algorithms, taking it all to the next level. You'll learn how to build your mazes in multiple dimensions, and even on curved surfaces.<br/><br/>Through it all, you'll discover yourself brimming with <i>ideas</i>, the best medicine for programmer's block, burn-out, and the grayest of days. By the time you're done, you'll be energized and full of maze-related possibilities!<br/><br/><b>What You Need:</b><br/><br/>The example code requires version 2 of the Ruby programming language. Some examples depend on the ChunkyPNG library to generate PNG images, and one chapter uses POV-Ray version 3.7 to render 3D graphics.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><strong>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4A:  Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1</strong></p><p>Knuth’s multivolume analysis of algorithms is widely recognized as the definitive description of classical computer science. The first three volumes of this work have long comprised a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of Knuth’s analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his “cookbook” solutions to their day-to-day problems.</p><p><i>The level of these first three volumes has remained so high, and they have displayed so wide and deep a familiarity with the art of computer programming, that a sufficient “review” of future volumes could almost be: “Knuth, Volume n has been published.”</i></p><p>–<i>Data Processing Digest</i></p><p>Knuth, Volume n has been published, where n = 4A.</p><p><i>In this long-awaited new volume, the old master turns his attention to some of his favorite topics in broadword computation and combinatorial generation (exhaustively listing fundamental combinatorial objects, such as permutations, partitions, and trees), as well as his more recent interests, such as binary decision diagrams.</i></p><p><i>The hallmark qualities that distinguish his previous volumes are manifest here anew: detailed coverage of the basics, illustrated with well-chosen examples; occasional forays into more esoteric topics and problems at the frontiers of research; impeccable writing peppered with occasional bits of humor; extensive collections of exercises, all with solutions or helpful hints; a careful attention to history; implementations of many of the algorithms in his classic step-by-step form.</i></p><p><i>There is an amazing amount of information on each page. Knuth has obviously thought long and hard about which topics and results are most central and important, and then, what are the most intuitive and succinct ways of presenting that material. Since the areas that he covers in this volume have exploded since he first envisioned writing about them, it is wonderful how he has managed to provide such thorough treatment in so few pages</i>.</p><p>–Frank Ruskey, Department of Computer Science, University of Victoria</p><p>The book is Volume 4A, because Volume 4 has itself become a multivolume undertaking. Combinatorial searching is a rich and important topic, and Knuth has too much to say about it that is new, interesting, and useful to fit into a single volume, or two, or maybe even three. This book alone includes approximately 1500 exercises, with answers for self-study, plus hundreds of useful facts that cannot be found in any other publication. Volume 4A surely belongs beside the first three volumes of this classic work in every serious programmer’s library.</p><p>Finally, after a wait of more than thirty-five years, the first part of Volume 4 is at last ready for publication. Check out the boxed set that brings together Volumes 1 - 4A in one elegant case, and offers the purchaser a $50 discount off the price of buying the four volumes individually.</p><p>Ebook (PDF version) produced by Mathematical Sciences Publishers (MSP),<a href=\"http://msp.org/\">http://msp.org</a></p><p><strong>The Art of Computer Programming, Volumes 1-4A Boxed Set, 3/e</strong></p><p>ISBN: 0321751043 </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>This multivolume work on the analysis of\nalgorithms has long been recognized as the definitive description\nof classical computer science. The four volumes published to date\nalready comprise a unique and invaluable resource in programming\ntheory and practice. Countless readers have spoken about the\nprofound personal influence of Knuth’s writings. Scientists\nhave marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while\npracticing programmers have successfully applied his\n“cookbook” solutions to their day-to-day problems. All\nhave admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good\nhumor found in his books.</p><p>To continue the fourth and later volumes of\nthe set, and to update parts of the existing volumes, Knuth has\ncreated a series of small books called fascicles, which are\npublished at regular intervals. Each fascicle encompasses a section\nor more of wholly new or revised material. Ultimately, the content\nof these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final\nversions of each volume, and the enormous undertaking that began in\n1962 will be complete.</p><p><b>Volume 4 Fascicle 6</b></p><p>This fascicle, brimming with lively\nexamples, forms the middle third of what will eventually become\nhardcover Volume 4B. It introduces and surveys\n“Satisfiability,’’ one of the most fundamental\nproblems in all of computer science: Given a Boolean function, can\nits variables be set to at least one pattern of 0s and 1s that will\nmake the function true?</p><p>Satisfiability is far from an abstract\nexercise in understanding formal systems. Revolutionary methods for\nsolving such problems emerged at the beginning of the twenty-first\ncentury, and they’ve led to game-changing applications in\nindustry. These so-called “SAT solvers’’ can now\nroutinely find solutions to practical problems that involve\nmillions of variables and were thought until very recently to be\nhopelessly difficult.</p><p>Fascicle 6 presents full details of seven\ndifferent SAT solvers, ranging from simple algorithms suitable for\nsmall problems to state-of-the-art algorithms of industrial\nstrength. Many other significant topics also arise in the course of\nthe discussion, such as bounded model checking, the theory of\ntraces, Las Vegas algorithms, phase changes in random processes,\nthe efficient encoding of problems into conjunctive normal form,\nand the exploitation of global and local symmetries. More than 500\nexercises are provided, arranged carefully for self-instruction,\ntogether with detailed answers.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>A detailed review of a wide range of meta-heuristic and evolutionary algorithms in a systematic manner and how they relate to engineering optimization problems</b></p><p>This book introduces the main metaheuristic algorithms and their applications in optimization. It describes 20 leading meta-heuristic and evolutionary algorithms and presents discussions and assessments of their performance in solving optimization problems from several fields of engineering. The book features clear and concise principles and presents detailed descriptions of leading methods such as the pattern search (PS) algorithm, the genetic algorithm (GA), the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm, the Tabu search (TS) algorithm, the ant colony optimization (ACO), and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique.</p><p>Chapter 1 of <i>Meta-heuristic and Evolutionary Algorithms for Engineering Optimization </i>provides an overview of optimization and defines it by presenting examples of optimization problems in different engineering domains. Chapter 2 presents an introduction to meta-heuristic and evolutionary algorithms and links them to engineering problems. Chapters 3 to 22 are each devoted to a separate algorithm— and they each start with a brief literature review of the development of the algorithm, and its applications to engineering problems. The principles, steps, and execution of the algorithms are described in detail, and a pseudo code of the algorithm is presented, which serves as a guideline for coding the algorithm to solve specific applications.

			"description": "<span><span>Graphs are about connections, and are an important part of our connected and data-driven world. <i>A Librarian's Guide to Graphs, Data and the Semantic Web</i> is geared toward library and information science professionals, including librarians, software developers and information systems architects who want to understand the fundamentals of graph theory, how it is used to represent and explore data, and how it relates to the semantic web. This title provides a firm grounding in the field at a level suitable for a broad audience, with an emphasis on open source solutions and what problems these tools solve at a conceptual level, with minimal emphasis on algorithms or mathematics. The text will also be of special interest to data science librarians and data professionals, since it introduces many graph theory concepts by exploring data-driven networks from various scientific disciplines. The first two chapters consider graphs in theory and the science of networks, before the following chapters cover networks in various disciplines. Remaining chapters move on to library networks, graph tools, graph analysis libraries, information problems and network solutions, and semantic graphs and the semantic web.<br/><br/><ul><li>Provides an accessible introduction to network science that is suitable for a broad audience</li><li>Devotes several chapters to a survey of how graph theory has been used in a number of scientific data-driven disciplines</li><li>Explores how graph theory could aid library and information scientists</li></ul></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>“Ask a mechanical, structural, or electrical engineer how\nfar they would get without a heavy reliance on a firm mathematical\nfoundation, and they will tell you, ‘not far.’ Yet\nso-called software engineers often practice their art with little\nor no idea of the mathematical underpinnings of what they are\ndoing. And then we wonder why software is notorious for being\ndelivered late and full of bugs, while other engineers routinely\ndeliver finished bridges, automobiles, electrical appliances, etc.,\non time and with only minor defects. This book sets out to redress\nthis imbalance. Members of my advanced development team at Adobe\nwho took the course based on the same material all benefited\ngreatly from the time invested. It may appear as a highly technical\ntext intended only for computer scientists, but it should be\nrequired reading for all practicing software\nengineers.”<br/>\n    —Martin Newell, Adobe Fellow<br/>\n<br/>\n “The book contains some of the most beautiful code I\nhave ever seen.”<br/>\n    —Bjarne Stroustrup, Designer of C++<br/>\n<br/>\n“I am happy to see the content of Alex’s course, the\ndevelopment and teaching of which I strongly supported as the CTO\nof Silicon Graphics, now available to all programmers in this\nelegant little book.”<br/>\n    —Forest Baskett, General Partner, New\nEnterprise Associates<br/>\n<br/>\n“Paul’s patience and architectural experience helped to\norganize Alex’s  mathematical approach into a\ntightly-structured edifice—an impressive feat!”<br/>\n    —Robert W. Taylor, Founder of Xerox PARC\nCSL and DEC Systems Research Center<br/>\n<br/>\n<b><em>Elements of Programming</em></b> provides a different\nunderstanding of programming than is presented elsewhere. Its major\npremise is that practical programming, like other areas of science\nand engineering,must be based on a solid mathematical foundation.\nThe book shows that algorithms implemented in a real programming\nlanguage, such as C++, can operate in the most general mathematical\nsetting. For example, the fast exponentiation  algorithm is\ndefined to work with any associative operation. Using abstract\nalgorithms leads to efficient, reliable, secure, and economical\nsoftware.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not an easy book. Nor is it a compilation of tips and\ntricks for incremental improvements in your programming skills. The\nbook’s value is more fundamental and, ultimately, more\ncritical for insight into programming. To benefit fully, you will\nneed to work through it from beginning to end, reading the code,\nproving the lemmas, and doing the exercises. When finished, you\nwill see how the application of the deductive method to your\nprograms assures that your system’s software components will\nwork together and behave as they must.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book presents a number of algorithms and requirements for types\non which they are defined. The code for these\ndescriptions—also available on the Web—is written in a\nsmall subset of C++ meant to be accessible to any experienced\nprogrammer. This subset is defined in a special language appendix\ncoauthored by Sean Parent and Bjarne Stroustrup.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhether you are a software developer, or any other professional for\nwhom programming is an important activity, or a committed student,\nyou will come to understand what the book’s experienced\nauthors have been teaching and demonstrating for years—that\nmathematics is good for programming, and that theory is good for\npractice.<br/>\n<br/></p></span></span>",

The focus this time is on graph algorithms, which are increasingly critical for a wide range of applications, such as network connectivity, circuit design, scheduling, transaction processing, and resource allocation. In this book, Sedgewick offers the same successful blend of theory and practice that has made his work popular with programmers for many years. Michael Schidlowsky and Sedgewick have developed concise new Java implementations that both express the methods in a natural and direct manner and also can be used in real applications.</p><p><strong><em>Algorithms in Java, Third Edition, Part 5: Graph Algorithms</em></strong> is the second book in Sedgewick's thoroughly revised and rewritten series. The first book, Parts 1-4, addresses fundamental algorithms, data structures, sorting, and searching. A forthcoming third book will focus on strings, geometry, and a range of advanced algorithms. Each book's expanded coverage features new algorithms and implementations, enhanced descriptions and diagrams, and a wealth of new exercises for polishing skills. The natural match between Java classes and abstract data type (ADT) implementations makes the code more broadly useful and relevant for the modern object-oriented programming environment.</p><p>The Web site for this book (<a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/\">www.cs.princeton.edu/~rs/</a>) provides additional source code for programmers along with a variety of academic support materials for educators.</p><p>Coverage includes:</p><ul><li><p>A complete overview of graph properties and types</p></li><li><p>Diagraphs and DAGs</p></li><li><p>Minimum spanning trees</p></li><li><p>Shortest paths</p></li><li><p>Network flows</p></li><li><p>Diagrams, sample Java code, and detailed algorithm descriptions</p></li></ul><p>A landmark revision, <strong><em>Algorithms in Java, Third Edition, Part 5</em></strong> provides a complete tool set for programmers to implement, debug, and use graph algorithms across a wide range of computer applications.</p></div></span>",

Until now, the journal has only been available online or printed and distributed for free at hacker conferences worldwide.<br/><br/>Consistent with the journal's quirky, biblical style, this book comes with all the trimmings: a leatherette cover, ribbon bookmark, bible paper, and gilt-edged pages. The book features more than 80 technical essays from numerous famous hackers, authors of classics like \"Reliable Code Execution on a Tamagotchi,\" \"ELFs are Dorky, Elves are Cool,\" \"Burning a Phone,\" \"Forget Not the Humble Timing Attack,\" and \"A Sermon on Hacker Privilege.\" Twenty-four full-color pages by Ange Albertini illustrate many of the clever tricks described in the text.\"</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><div><p>Many programmers would love to use Perl for projects that involve heavy  lifting, but miss the many traditional algorithms that textbooks teach  for other languages. Computer scientists have identified many techniques that a wide range of programs need, such as:</p><ul><li>Fuzzy pattern matching for text (identify misspellings!)</li><li>Finding correlations in data</li><li>Game-playing algorithms</li><li>Predicting phenomena such as Web traffic</li><li>Polynomial and spline fitting</li></ul>Using algorithms explained in this book, you too can carry out traditional programming tasks in a high-powered, efficient, easy-to-maintain manner with Perl.This book assumes a basic understanding of Perl syntax and functions,  but not necessarily any background in computer science. The authors explain in a readable fashion the reasons for using various classic programming techniques, the kind of applications that use them, and -- most  important -- how to code these algorithms in Perl.If you are an amateur programmer, this book will fill you in on the  essential algorithms you need to solve problems like an expert. If you have already learned algorithms in other languages, you will be  surprised at how much different (and often easier) it is to implement them  in Perl. And yes, the book even has the obligatory fractal display program.There have been dozens of books on programming algorithms, some of them excellent, but never before has there been one that uses Perl.<b>The authors include the editor of <i>The Perl Journal</i> and master  librarian of CPAN; all are contributors to CPAN and have archived much of the code in this book there.</b>\"This book was so exciting I lost sleep reading it.\" Tom Christiansen</div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>\nImplementing cryptography requires integers of significant magnitude to resist cryptanalytic attacks. Modern programming languages only provide support for integers which are relatively small and single precision. The purpose of this text is to instruct the reader regarding how to implement efficient multiple precision algorithms.<br/><br/>Bignum math is the backbone of modern computer security algorithms. It is the ability to work with hundred-digit numbers efficiently using techniques that are both elegant and occasionally bizarre. This book introduces the reader to the concept of bignum algorithms and proceeds to build an entire library of functionality from the ground up. Through the use of theory, pseudo-code and actual fielded C source code the book explains each and every algorithm that goes into a modern bignum library. Excellent for the student as a learning tool and practitioner as a reference alike BigNum Math is for anyone with a background in computer science who has taken introductory level mathematic courses. The text is for students learning mathematics and cryptography as well as the practioner who needs a reference for any of the algorithms documented within.<br/><br/>* Complete coverage of Karatsuba Multiplication, the Barrett Algorithm, Toom-Cook 3-Way Multiplication, and More <br/><br/>* Tom St Denis is the developer of the industry standard cryptographic suite of tools called LibTom. <br/><br/>* This book provides step-by-step exercises to enforce concepts\n</span>",

			"title": "Essential Java for AP CompSci: From Programming to Computer Science",
			"description": "<span><p>Gain the essential skills for computer science using one of today's most popular programming languages, Java. This book will prepare you for AP CompSci Complete, but you don’t need to be sitting that class to benefit. Computer science has become a basic life skill that everyone is going to need to learn. Whether you are going into a career or side hustle in business, technology, creativity, architecture, or almost any other field, you will find coding and computer science play a role. </p><p>So when we learn programming we are going to focus on three things: what is the process; what is the syntax; and what is the flow. The process is represented as a flowchart. We will learn how to make these to help you plan out what you are going to do before you write a line of code. At first, the flowcharts will be pretty simple, but then they will get more complex. The syntax is the code: this is what you write that translates the process you create in a flowchart to the instructions that the computer can understand. Finally, there is the flow. This is where you trace through the code and see how the data and information it stores along the way changes. You can see how the operation of the program cascades from line to line. You will be building charts that will capture the programming flow so you can better understand how the computer processes code to make your next program easier to conceive and code.</p><p>Along the way to aid in the learning of the essential Java skills, there will be three kinds of project types throughout this book: business software projects for applications where you work for a company and need to complete an internal project for a team such as the sales, marketing, or data science teams; social good projects where you are working for non-profits or for agencies that are trying to research and provide solutions to economic, environmental, medical, or humanitarian projects; and game development projects for games based on player input, random chance, or other mechanics for the use of entertainment.</p><p>What is unique about computer science is how it has become a skill, and not just a career. While there are jobs and titles of “computer scientist”, the skill of computer science, and specifically programming, are almost everywhere. After reading and using this book, you'll have the essential skills to think like a computer scientist, even if you are not. As a result you’ll be of greater value to your clients, your company, and yourself.  </p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul>  Discover the primary building blocks of      programming using the Java programming language  <li>See terminology and best practices of software      development</li> <li>Work with object-oriented programming concepts</li> <li>Use common-language definitions and examples to      help drive understanding and comprehension of computer science      fundamentals</li> </ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p> </p><p>Those who want to learn programming and want to think like a computer scientist. Ideal for anyone taking AP CompSci Complete.</p><div><p></p></div></span>",

With a principles-oriented introduction to computational thinking, the text provides a broader and deeper introduction to computer science than typical introductory programming books.<br/><br/>Organized around interdisciplinary problem domains, rather than programming language features, each chapter guides students through increasingly sophisticated algorithmic and programming techniques. The author uses a spiral approach to introduce Python language features in increasingly complex contexts as the book progresses.<br/><br/>The text places programming in the context of fundamental computer science principles, such as abstraction, efficiency, and algorithmic techniques, and offers overviews of fundamental topics that are traditionally put off until later courses.<br/><br/>The book includes thirty well-developed independent projects that encourage students to explore questions across disciplinary boundaries. Each is motivated by a problem that students can investigate by developing algorithms and implementing them as Python programs.<br/><br/>The book's accompanying website — http://discoverCS.denison.edu — includes sample code and data files, pointers for further exploration, errata, and links to Python language references.<br/><br/>Containing over 600 homework exercises and over 300 integrated reflection questions, this textbook is appropriate for a first computer science course for computer science majors, an introductory scientific computing course or, at a slower pace, any introductory computer science course.</p></span></span>",

The three complete volumes published to date already comprise a unique and invaluable resource in programming theory and practice. Countless readers have spoken about the profound personal influence of Knuth’s writings. Scientists have marveled at the beauty and elegance of his analysis, while practicing programmers have successfully applied his “cookbook” solutions to their day-to-day problems. All have admired Knuth for the breadth, clarity, accuracy, and good humor found in his books.</p><br/><p>To begin the fourth and later volumes of the set, and to update parts of the existing three, Knuth has created a series of small books called fascicles, which will be published at regular intervals. Each fascicle will encompass a section or more of wholly new or revised material. Ultimately, the content of these fascicles will be rolled up into the comprehensive, final versions of each volume, and the enormous undertaking that began in 1962 will be complete.</p><br/><p><strong>Volume 4, Fascicle 1</strong></p><br/><p>This fascicle, enlivened by a wealth of Knuth’s typically enjoyable examples, describes basic “broadword” operations and an important class of data structures that can make computer programs run dozens–even thousands–of times faster. The author brings together and explains a substantial amount of previously scattered but eminently practical information known only to a few specialists. The book also includes nearly five-hundred exercises for self-study, with detailed answers given in nearly every case; dozens of these exercises present original material that has never before been published. Simply put, this fascicle is a must-have for anybody who is faced with tough problems of a combinatorial flavor. It demonstrates how ordinary programmers can make use of powerful techniques that heretofore seemed to be available only to people who used specialized languages and software. It shows how ideas once thought to be “far out” are now ready to become a part of the programming mainstream.</p></span>",

			"title": "Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web: From HTML5 Microdata to Linked Open Data",
			"description": "<span><span><p/><p>\n   A major limitation of conventional web sites is their unorganized and isolated contents, which is created mainly for human consumption. This limitation can be addressed by organizing and publishing data, using powerful formats that add structure and meaning to the content of web pages and link related data to one another. Computers can \"\"understand\"\" such data better, which can be useful for task automation. The web sites that provide semantics (meaning) to software agents form the Semantic Web, the Artificial Intelligence extension of the World Wide Web. In contrast to the conventional Web (the \"\"Web of Documents\"\"), the Semantic Web includes the \"\"Web of Data\"\", which connects \"\"things\"\" (representing real-world humans and objects) rather than documents meaningless to computers. <em>Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web</em> explains the practical aspects and the theory behind the Semantic Web and how structured data, such as HTML5 Microdata and JSON-LD, can be used to improve your site’s performance on next-generation Search Engine Result Pages and be displayed on Google Knowledge Panels. You will learn how to represent arbitrary fields of human knowledge in a machine-interpretable form using the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the cornerstone of the Semantic Web. You will see how to store and manipulate RDF data in purpose-built graph databases such as triplestores and quadstores, that are exploited in Internet marketing, social media, and data mining, in the form of Big Data applications such as the Google Knowledge Graph, Wikidata, or Facebook’s Social Graph.</p><p>With the constantly increasing user expectations in web services and applications, Semantic Web standards gain more popularity. This book will familiarize you with the leading controlled vocabularies and ontologies and explain how to represent your own concepts. After learning the principles of Linked Data, the five-star deployment scheme, and the Open Data concept, you will be able to create and interlink five-star Linked Open Data, and merge your RDF graphs to the LOD Cloud. The book also covers the most important tools for generating, storing, extracting, and visualizing RDF data, including, but not limited to, Protégé, TopBraid Composer, Sindice, Apache Marmotta, Callimachus, and Tabulator. You will learn to implement Apache Jena and Sesame in popular IDEs such as Eclipse and NetBeans, and use these APIs for rapid Semantic Web application development. <em>Mastering Structured Data on the Semantic Web</em> demonstrates how to represent and connect structured data to reach a wider audience, encourage data reuse, and provide content that can be automatically processed with full certainty. As a result, your web contents will be integral parts of the next revolution of the Web.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>\n    \nIt was once widely believed that quantum computation would never become a reality. However, the discovery of quantum error correction and the proof of the accuracy threshold theorem nearly ten years ago gave rise to extensive development and research aimed at creating a working, scalable quantum computer. Over a decade has passed since this monumental accomplishment yet no book-length pedagogical presentation of this important theory exists.    <p><b>Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerant Quantum Computing</b> offers the first full-length exposition on the realization of a theory once thought impossible. It provides in-depth coverage on the most important class of codes discovered to date—quantum stabilizer codes. It brings together the central themes of quantum error correction and fault-tolerant procedures to prove the accuracy threshold theorem for a particular noise error model. The author also includes a derivation of well-known bounds on the parameters of quantum error correcting code.    </p><p>Packed with over 40 real-world problems, 35 field exercises, and 17 worked-out examples, this book is the essential resource for any researcher interested in entering the quantum field as well as for those who want to understand how the unexpected realization of quantum computing is possible.</p>\n\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Many pundits tell you that the computer is ushering us toward a new Golden Age of Information. A few tell you that the computer is destroying everything worthwhile in our culture. But almost no one tells you what Stephen L. Talbott shows in this surprising book: the intelligent machine gathers its menacing powers from hidden places within you and me. It does so, that is, as long as we gaze into our screens and tap on our keyboards while less than fully conscious of the subtle influences passing through the interface.Talbott awakens us to these influences by conducting a wide-ranging tour:</p><li><p>Why do we hail the birth of the electronic global village just as villagers around the world are killing each other? Is the Net an instrument for social dissolution?</p></li><li><p>Do the Renaissance origins of virtual reality throw light on our world-creating and world-destroying choices today? Does reality have a future?</p></li><li><p>Were the barriers to creation of thinking machines clarified by a little-known philologist investigating the mythic consciousness of the ancients?</p></li><li><p>Does the computer centralize or decentralize structures of power? Or does this question miss the point, because intelligent machines that run by themselves are creating a new global totalitarianism without a despotic center?</p></li><li><p>Is the frantic urging to put schoolchildren on the Internet any more reasoned than the seventies' fad for programmed instruction, or the eighties' fad for computer literacy?</p></li><li><p>Does an unrecognized law link the public face and the dark underside of the Net? If so, can we expect flame wars, weird impersonations, pornographic commerce, and Net psychoses to grow increasingly pronounced and erratic, while at the same time the reasoned mechanisms for filtering \"strict business\" from the chaos steadily gain in effectiveness?</p></li><li><p>Is artificial intelligence raising machines to a human level, or are we descending to the machine's level?</p></li><p>After reading The Future Does Not Compute, you will never again be able to sit in front of your computer with quite the same glazed stare.(BACKCOVER COPY) The technological Djinn, now loosened from all restraints, tempts us with visions of a surreal future. It is a future with robots who surpass their masters in dexterity and wit; intelligent agents who roam the Net on our behalf, seeking the informational elixir that will make us whole; new communities inhabiting the clean, infinite reaches of cyberspace, freed from war and conflict; and lending libraries of \"virtually real\" experiences that seem more sensational than the real thing.Not all of this is idle or fantastic speculation -- even if it is the rather standard gush about our computerized future. Few observers can see any clear limits to what the networked computer might eventually accomplish. It is this stunning, wide-open potential that leads one to wonder what the Djinn will ask of us in return for the gift. After all, any potential so dramatic, so diverse, so universal, can be taken in many directions. That is its very nature. Who will choose the direction -- we, or the Djinn?The intelligent machine receives a shadow of our own intelligence. This shadow consists of all the collective, automatic, sleepwalking, deterministic processes we have yielded to. That is, it consists of our own willingness to become machines. The crucial question today is whether we can wake up in time. Only in wakefulness can we distinguish ourselves from the automatisms around us. Where we remain asleep -- where we live in our own shadow -- we are the Djinn.The Net is the most powerful invitation to remain asleep we have ever faced. Contrary to the usual view, it dwarfs television in its power to induce passivity, to scatter our minds, to destroy our imaginations, and to make us forget our humanity.And yet -- for these very reasons -- the Net may also be an opportunity to enter into our fullest humanity with a self-awareness never yet achieved. But few even seem aware of the challenge, and without awareness we will certainly fail.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "The Vanishing American Corporation",
			"description": "<span>\n    It may be hard to believe in an era of Walmart, Citizens United, and the Koch brothers, but corporations are on the decline. The number of American companies listed on the stock market dropped by half between 1996 and 2012. In recent years we've seen some of the most storied corporations go bankrupt (General Motors, Chrysler, Eastman Kodak) or disappear entirely (Bethlehem Steel, Lehman Brothers, Borders). <br/><br/>Gerald Davis argues this is a root cause of the income inequality and social instability we face today. Corporations were once an integral part of building the middle class. He points out that in their heyday they offered millions of people lifetime employment, a stable career path, health insurance, and retirement pensions. They were like small private welfare states. <br/><br/>The businesses that are replacing them will not fill the same role. For one thing, they employ far fewer people—the combined global workforces of Facebook, Yelp, Zynga, LinkedIn, Zillow, Tableau, Zulily, and Box are smaller than the number of people who lost their jobs when Circuit City was liquidated in 2009. And in the “sharing economy,” companies have no obligation to most of the people who work for them—at the end of 2014 Uber had over 160,000 “driver-partners” in the United States but recognized only about 2,000 people as actual employees.<br/><br/>Davis tracks the rise of the large American corporation and the economic, social, and technological developments that have led to its decline. The future could see either increasing economic polarization, as careers turn into jobs and jobs turn into tasks, or a more democratic economy built from the grass roots. It's up to us. <br/>\n  </span>",

Understanding and implementing them can be daunting. Curious learners and industrial developers can find these complex, especially if they focus on the detailed implementation of these data structures.</p><p>Clojure is a highly pragmatic and expressive language with efficient and easy data manipulation capabilities. As such, it is great for implementing these algorithms. By abstracting away a great share of the unnecessary complexity resulting from implementation, Clojure and its contrib libraries will help you address various algorithmic challenges, making your data exploration both profitable and enjoyable.</p><p>Through 25 recipes, you'll explore advanced algorithms and data-structures, well served by a sound Clojure implementation.</p><p>This book opens with an exploration of alternative uses of the array data-structure, covering LZ77 compression, drawing fractals using Pascal's triangles, simulating a multi-threaded program execution, and implementing a call-stack winding and un-winding operations.</p><p>The book elaborates on linked lists, showing you how to construct doubly linked ones, speed up search times over the elements of such structures, use a linked-list as the foundation of a shift-reduce parser, and implement an immutable linked-list using skew binary numbers representation.</p><p>After that, the tree data-structure is explored, focusing on building self-balancing Splay Trees, designing a B-Tree backing-up an efficient key-value data-store, constructing an undo capable Rope, and showing how Tries can make for an auto-completing facility.</p><p>Next, some optimization and machine learning techniques are discussed, namely for building a co-occurrence-based recommendation engine, using branch-and-bound to optimize integral cost and profit problems, using Dijkstra's algorithm to determine optimal paths and summarizing texts using the LexRank algorithm.</p><p>Particular attention is given to logic programming, you will learn to use this to discover interesting relations between social website data, by designing a simple type inferencer for a mini Java-like language, and by building a simple checkers game engine.</p><p>Asynchronous programming will be addressed and you will design a concurrent web-crawler, an interactive HTML5 game, and an online taxi booking platform.</p><p>Finally, you'll explore advanced cases for higher order functions in Clojure while implementing a recursive descent parser using efficient mutual resucrsion, devising a mini resusable firewall simulator thanks to Clojure 1.7 new tansducers feature or building a simple unification engine with the help of Continuation Passing Style.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Explore alternative uses of classical data-structures like arrays and linked-lists</li><li>Discover advanced types of tree data-structures</li><li>Explore advanced machine learning and optimization techniques</li><li>Utilise powerful Clojure libraries, such as Instaparse for parsing, core.match for pattern matching, clojure.zip for zippers, and clojure.matrix for matrix operations</li><li>Learn logic programming through the usage of the library core.logic</li><li>Master asynchronous programming using the core.async library</li><li>See the transducers in action while resolving real-world use-cases</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>If you are an experienced Clojure developer, longing to take your knowledge to the next level by discovering and using advanced algorithms and seeing how they can be applied to real-world problems, then this book is for you.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This book consists of a set of step-by-step recipes, each demonstrating the material covered in action so it is put in context.

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>The first book to explain the principals behind mobile 3D hardware implementation, helping readers understand advanced algorithms, produce low-cost, low-power SoCs, or become familiar with embedded systems</b></p><p>As mobile broadcasting and entertainment applications evolve, there is increasing interest in 3D graphics within the field of mobile electronics, particularly for handheld devices. In Mobile 3D Graphics SoC, Yoo provides a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms of mobile 3D graphics and their real chip implementation methods. 3D graphics SoC (System on a Chip) architecture and its interaction with embedded system software are explained with numerous examples. Yoo divides the book into three sections: general methodology of low power SoC, design of low power 3D graphics SoC, and silicon implementation of 3D graphics SoCs and their application to mobile electronics. Full examples are presented at various levels such as system level design and circuit level optimization along with design technology. Yoo incorporates many real chip examples, including many commercial 3D graphics chips, and provides cross-comparisons of various architectures and their performance. Furthermore, while advanced 3D graphics techniques are well understood and supported by industry standards, this is less true in the emerging mobile applications and games market. This book redresses this imbalance, providing an in-depth look at the new OpenGL ES (The Standard for Embedded Accelerated 3D Graphics), and shows what these new embedded systems graphics libraries can provide for 3D graphics and games developers.</p></span></span>",

Drucker's lectures and thoughts deserve to be considered by every person of responsibility, now, tomorrow, ten years from now, fifty, and a hundred.\"<br/><b>-Jim Collins, author of <i>Good to Great</i> and <i>How the Mighty Fall</i></b></p><p>\"Rick Wartzman has brought Peter Drucker alive again, and vividly so, in his own words. These samples of his talks and lectures, because they were spoken not written, will be new to almost all of us. A great and unexpected treat.\"<br/><b>-Charles Handy, author of <i>Myself and Other More Important Matters</i></b></p><p>\"Peter Drucker's ideas continue to resonate powerfully today. His lectures on effectiveness, innovation, the social sector, education and so much more provide fresh insights that extend beyond his other writings and provide lessons for us all. This book is a gem.\"<br/><b>-Wendy Kopp, CEO and founder of Teach for America</b></p><p>\"Rick Wartzman has performed a great service in pulling together <i>The Drucker Lectures</i>. The collection is as far-ranging as Drucker's thinking and writing. If you have sampled Drucker before, you will find things you haven't seen. Peter's ideas live on. You will be energized by reading them anew.\"<br/><b>-Paul O'Neill, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury</b></p><p>\"Peter Drucker inspires awe. From the 1940s until his death a few years ago, he displayed a combination of insight, prescience, and productivity that few will ever match. This superbly edited collection captures both the range of Drucker's thinking and the sweep of history that informed it. <i>The Drucker Lectures</i> is a riveting read that reveals the depth and subtlety of one of America's most remarkable minds.\"<br/><b>-Daniel H. Pink, author of <i>A Whole New Mind</i> and <i>Drive</i></b></p><p>\"Rick Wartzman really has brought Peter to life in <i>The Drucker Lectures</i>. Reading this book, I practically felt as though I were seated in the audience, listening to my friend and hero, Peter Drucker-truly one of the great geniuses of management. These lectures are as vital today as they were when Peter delivered them. They cover significant territory, from the importance of faith and the individual to the rise of the global economy. It's a classic collection that belongs on every manager's bookshelf.\"<br/><b>-Ken Blanchard, coauthor of <i>The One Minute Manager</i> and <i>Leading at a Higher Level</i></b></p><p><b>Previously unpublished talks from the Father of Modern Management</b></p><p>Throughout his professional life, Peter F. Drucker inspired millions of business leaders not only through his famous writings but also through his lectures and keynotes. These speeches contained some of his most valuable insights, but had never been published in book form—until now.</p><p><i>The Drucker Lectures</i> features more than 30 talks from one of management's most important figures. Drawn from the Drucker Archives at the Drucker Institute at Claremont Graduate University, the lectures showcase Drucker's wisdom, wit, profundity, and prescience on such topics as:</p><ul><li>Politics and economics of the environment</li><li>Knowledge workers and the Knowledge Society</li><li>Computer and information literacy</li><li>Managing nonprofit organizations</li><li>Globalization</li></ul><p>During his life, Drucker well understood that over the last 150 years the world had become a society of large institutions—and that they would only become larger and more powerful. He contended that unless these institutions were effectively managed and ethically led, the good health of society as a whole would be in peril. His prediction is unfolding before our eyes.</p><p><i>The Drucker Lectures</i> is a timely, instructive book proving that responsible behavior and good business can, in fact, exist hand in hand.</p></span></span>",

In other words, squares are a subtype of rectangles, and rectangles are a supertype of squares. Recognizing and acting upon such subtype / supertype relationships provides numerous benefits: Certainly it can help in data modeling, and it can also provide for code reuse in applications. For these reasons, many languages, including the standard database language SQL, have long supported such relationships. However, there doesn’t seem to be any consensus in the community at large on a formal, rigorous, and abstract model of inheritance. This book proposes such a model, one that enjoys several advantages over other approaches, not the least of which it is that it’s fully compatible with the well known relational model of data.</p></span></span></span>",

Based on material refined in the author’s university courses, the book has immediate applicability for working system engineers or recent graduates who understand computer technology, but have the unfamiliar task of applying their knowledge to a real business problem.</p><p>Starting with a comparison of synthesis and analysis, the book explains the fundamental building blocks of systems-atoms and events-and takes a graph-theoretical approach to database design to encourage a well-designed schema. The author explains how database systems work-useful both when working with a commercial database management system and when hand-crafting data structures-and how events control the way data flows through a system. Later chapters deal with system dynamics and modelling, rule-based systems, user psychology, and project management, to round out readers’ ability to understand and solve business problems.</p><ul><li>Bridges computer science theory with practical business problems to lead readers from requirements to a working system without error or backtracking</li><li>Explains use-definition analysis to derive process graphs and avoid large-scale designs that don’t quite work</li><li>Demonstrates functional dependency graphs to allow databases to be designed without painful iteration</li><li>Includes chapters on system dynamics and modeling, rule-based systems, user psychology, and project management</li></ul></span>",

			"title": "Towards A Semantic Web",
			"description": "<span>This book addresses the question of how knowledge is currently documented, and may soon be documented in the context of what it calls ‘semantic publishing’. This takes two forms: a more narrowly and technically defined ‘semantic web’; as well as a broader notion of semantic publishing. This book examines the ways in which knowledge is represented in journal articles and books. By contrast, it goes on to explore the potential impacts of semantic publishing on academic research and authorship. It sets this in the context of changing knowledge ecologies: the way research is done; the way knowledge is represented and; the modes of knowledge access used by researchers, students and the general public.<br/><br/><ul><li>Provides an introduction to the ‘semantic web’ and semantic publishing for readers outside the field of computer science</li><li>Discusses the relevance of the ‘semantic web’ and semantic publishing more broadly, and its application to academic research</li><li>Examines the changing ecologies of knowledge production</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>While theories based on classical physics have been very successful in helping experimentalists design microelectronic devices, new approaches based on quantum mechanics are required to accurately model nanoscale transistors and to predict their characteristics even before they are fabricated. <strong>Advanced Nanoelectronics </strong>provides research information on advanced nanoelectronics concepts, with a focus on modeling and simulation. Featuring contributions by researchers actively engaged in nanoelectronics research, it develops and applies analytical formulations to investigate nanoscale devices.</p><p>The book begins by introducing the basic ideas related to quantum theory that are needed to better understand nanoscale structures found in nanoelectronics, including graphenes, carbon nanotubes, and quantum wells, dots, and wires. It goes on to highlight some of the key concepts required to understand nanotransistors. These concepts are then applied to the carbon nanotube field effect transistor (CNTFET).</p><p>Several chapters cover graphene, an unzipped form of CNT that is the recently discovered allotrope of carbon that has gained a tremendous amount of scientific and technological interest. The book discusses the development of the graphene nanoribbon field effect transistor (GNRFET) and its use as a possible replacement to overcome the CNT chirality challenge. It also examines silicon nanowire (SiNW) as a new candidate for achieving the downscaling of devices. The text describes the modeling and fabrication of SiNW, including a new top-down fabrication technique. Strained technology, which changes the properties of device materials rather than changing the device geometry, is also discussed.</p><p>The book ends with a look at the technical and economic challenges that face the commercialization of nanoelectronics and what universities, industries, and government can do to lower the barriers. A useful resource for professionals, researchers, and scientists, this work brings together state-of-the-art technical and scientific information on important topics in advanced nanoelectronics.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><br>Foundations of Genetic Algorithms, Volume 2 provides insight of theoretical work in genetic algorithms. This book provides a general understanding of a canonical genetic algorithm.  Organized into six parts encompassing 19 chapters, this volume begins with an overview of genetic algorithms in the broader adaptive systems context. This text then reviews some results in mathematical genetics that use probability distributions to characterize the effects of recombination on multiple loci in the absence of selection. Other chapters examine the static building block hypothesis (SBBH), which is the underlying assumption used to define deception. This book discusses as well the effect of noise on the quality of convergence of genetic algorithms. The final chapter deals with the primary goal in machine learning and artificial intelligence, which is to dynamically and automatically decompose problems into simpler problems to facilitate their solution.  This book is a valuable resource for theorists and genetic algorithm researchers.<br></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>This book was written to provide insight into the development techniques needed (and the options available) to work within the DotNetNuke framework. Emphasis is placed on the available methods to extend the framework, as well as the situations and rules governing when each respective extension model should be used. Along with this emphasis on selecting the right extension method, the book stresses the importance of leveraging the framework in as many areas as possible, and ultimately using the framework to the advantage of the developer, rather than merely working with it.</p><p>One current weakness of the DotNetNuke framework is developer documentation. The framework provides developers with numerous amazing methods to extend the framework and build truly robust applications, but as of this writing, minimal API documentation exists, and overall development topics are scattered all over the Internet. Many community members have helped to supplement this lack of developer content by writing blog articles and technical tutorials to help teach the individual concepts, but because there is no central repository, it can be tedious and difficult to find just what you need.</p><p>This book helps truly identify and document some excellent new features that are supported starting with DotNetNuke 5.0. The inclusion of jQuery exposes developers to a great JavaScript library that will enable interactive and animated interfaces to be created easily. The new Module Packaging system (discussed in detail in Appendix D) provides module developers and skin designers with many much-needed options when it comes to deploying applications. This book was written to expose this information, and to function as a key resource for the development community.</p><p>This book assumes that the reader has a working knowledge of standard ASP.NET development techniques and terminologies. Samples in the book are provided in both C# and Visual Basic (VB) to enable readers with diverse backgrounds to fully understand the concepts presented. Users do not need to have a comprehensive understanding of DotNetNuke prior to using this book because the early chapters discuss the configuration of both DotNetNuke and the development environment, and careful consideration has been taken to ensure that DotNetNuke-specific terminology is explained as the book progresses.</p><p>Readers already familiar with DotNetNuke 4.x development will find this book valuable because it introduces many of the new features of the latest software version, although some of the beginning chapters for these readers will be redundant because the overall concepts of environment configuration and basic interface elements have not changed from 4.x to 5.x. Differences between versions 4.x and 5.x are pointed out as appropriate.</p><p>As the title implies, this book primarily covers development techniques within the DotNetNuke 5.x platform. The chapters point out similarities and differences between the 4.x and 5.x platforms, enabling readers to apply some newer concepts to the older technology. Although this book primarily focuses on the concept of module development, it discusses other extension models as well, such as skin objects and authentication providers. Also covered in this book are recommended practices for successful integration with the framework.</p><p>This book begins with an introduction to development within DotNetNuke. The discussions walk you through DotNetNuke setup, terminology, development environment setup, and options for .NET project setup.</p><p>The book then presents a scenario-based model to introduce basic concepts of module development. This is accomplished by building a simple guestbook module that demonstrates how individual portions interact with one another. The discussion lays the foundation for the most basic elements of development within DotNetNuke. Later in the book, you learn about the more advanced module programming concepts, such as optional interfaces and DotNetNuke user controls. This discussion additionally introduces other extension methods, such as authentication providers and skin objects, as well as best practices.</p><p>In short, the main content of the book creates a working model that guides you through the most common development scenarios; at the same time, it provides the detail needed to tightly integrate custom code with the framework.</p><p>The appendixes provide supplemental information to what is contained in the chapters. This is material that, while not critical to an understanding of the individual chapters, is nonetheless important. The appendixes include items such as community resources and general DotNetNuke configuration items, as well as a detailed look at the new module manifest and a few key integration API points that are not well documented overall.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><br/>      This book addresses the difficulty of obtaining a quality solution, that is, pre optimal or even optimal, in a reasonable time from a central processing unit (CPU). As polynomial problems can be treated by exact methods, the problem posed concerns non-polynomial problems, for which it is necessary to develop efficient algorithms based on heuristics or meta-heuristics. Chapter 3 of this book demonstrates how to develop such algorithms, which are characterized by: an initialization of argued solutions (sometimes, the global optimum can be obtained from such an initialization); a non-random generation of solutions (to avoid generating the same solution several times, or even generating solutions that cannot be achieved); avoidance of being trapped by a local optimum; good use of CPU time by reducing the size of the space of solutions to be explored (which is often very large for such problems) without compromising the quality of the solution; plus a reasoned displacement from one solution to another, to improve the quality of the solution as the processing is carried out. These aspects are applied to concrete applications in the design of integrated circuits and systems at various levels. To do this and to help the reader better understand this problem, Chapters 1 and 2 present basic notions on computational complexity, and the design of integrated circuits and systems.<br/>   </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>With an ever-increasing amount of information on the web, it is critical to understand the pedigree, quality, and accuracy of your data. Using provenance, you can ascertain the quality of data based on its ancestral data and derivations, track back to sources of errors, allow automatic re-enactment of derivations to update data, and provide attribution of the data source. <br/><br/><strong>Secure Data Provenance and Inference Control with Semantic Web</strong> supplies step-by-step instructions on how to secure the provenance of your data to make sure it is safe from inference attacks. It details the design and implementation of a policy engine for provenance of data and presents case studies that illustrate solutions in a typical distributed health care system for hospitals. Although the case studies describe solutions in the health care domain, you can easily apply the methods presented in the book to a range of other domains.<br/><br/>The book describes the design and implementation of a policy engine for provenance and demonstrates the use of Semantic Web technologies and cloud computing technologies to enhance the scalability of solutions. It covers Semantic Web technologies for the representation and reasoning of the provenance of the data and provides a unifying framework for securing provenance that can help to address the various criteria of your information systems. <br/><br/>Illustrating key concepts and practical techniques, the book considers cloud computing technologies that can enhance the scalability of solutions. After reading this book you will be better prepared to keep up with the on-going development of the prototypes, products, tools, and standards for secure data management, secure Semantic Web, secure web services, and secure cloud computing.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span>New technologies will underpin the future generation of library catalogues. To facilitate their role providing information, serving users, and fulfilling their mission as cultural heritage and memory institutions, libraries must take a technological leap; their standards and services must be transformed to those of the Semantic Web. Bibliographic Information Organization in the Semantic Web explores the technologies that may power future library catalogues, and argues the necessity of such a leap. The text introduces international bibliographic standards and models, and fundamental concepts in their representation in the context of the Semantic Web. Subsequent chapters cover bibliographic information organization, linked open data, methodologies for publishing library metadata, discussion of the wider environment (museum, archival and publishing communities) and users, followed by a conclusion.<br/><br/><ul><li>The product of over thirty years’ experience and in-depth understanding of bibliographic metadata</li><li>Takes both a bottom up and top down approach: from basic standards and case studies to Semantic Web tools and services; and from abstract models and generic guidelines to applications</li><li>Tells an insiders’ story of the experience developing tools for the transition of library systems, metadata, and its utility, into the new milieu</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>An essential overview of quantum information</b></p><p>Information, whether inscribed as a mark on a stone tablet or encoded as a magnetic domain on a hard drive, must be stored in a physical object and thus made subject to the laws of physics. Traditionally, information processing such as computation occurred in a framework governed by laws of classical physics. However, information can also be stored and processed using the states of matter described by non-classical quantum theory. Understanding this quantum information, a fundamentally different type of information, has been a major project of physicists and information theorists in recent years, and recent experimental research has started to yield promising results.</p><p>Quantum Approach to Informatics fills the need for a concise introduction to this burgeoning new field, offering an intuitive approach for readers in both the physics and information science communities, as well as in related fields. Only a basic background in quantum theory is required, and the text keeps the focus on bringing this theory to bear on contemporary informatics. Instead of proofs and other highly formal structures, detailed examples present the material, making this a uniquely accessible introduction to quantum informatics.</p><p>Topics covered include:</p><ul><li><p>An introduction to quantum information and the qubit</p></li><li><p>Concepts and methods of quantum theory important for informatics</p></li><li><p>The application of information concepts to quantum physics</p></li><li><p>Quantum information processing and computing</p></li><li><p>Quantum gates</p></li><li><p>Error correction using quantum-based methods</p></li><li><p>Physical realizations of quantum computing circuits</p></li></ul><p>A helpful and economical resource for understanding this exciting new application of quantum theory to informatics, Quantum Approach to Informatics provides students and researchers in physics and information science, as well as other interested readers with some scientific background, with an essential overview of the field.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "The Upside of Turbulence",
			"description": "<span><span><p/><p/><p>A provocative user's guide to a world where the only thing that doesn't change is change itself</p><p>\"Before I die,\" Albert Einstein once said, \"I hope someone will clarify quantum physics for me. After I die, I hope God will explain turbulence to me.\" Einstein might have been more confused today: Turbulence, in all its manifestations, is on the rise. Financial markets gyrate. Commodity prices zig and zag. New technologies disrupt long-standing businesses and entire industries. Scientific discoveries overturn historical truisms. Dirty bombs and pension busts, natural disasters and flu pandemics, add to the tumult. We live in a world beset by turbulence.</p><p>We often respond to turbulence by accelerating activities that worked in the past. We lapse into inertia when we should adapt with agility, and we cling to rigid dogmas when we should improvise. But throughout history, volatility has not only dethroned incumbent leaders, it has also created untold possibilities to create economic value. Turbulence has an upside, and companies that seize the opportunities arising out of seething markets will become tomorrow's champions. </p><p>Based on more than a decade of research, <em>The Upside of Turbulence</em> draws lessons from companies that have consistently spotted and exploited opportunities that rivals have missed. The book explores realms ranging from improvisational comedy to the U.S. Marine Corp's combat doctrine. The result is a series of provocative insights that defy conventional wisdom. The book also introduces practical tools, which have been field-tested by executives around the world, to wrestle triumph out of turmoil.   </p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>The breathtakingly rapid pace of change in computing makes it easy to overlook the pioneers who began it all. Written by Martin Davis, respected logician and researcher in the theory of computation, <strong>The Universal Computer: The Road from Leibniz to Turing</strong> explores the fascinating lives, ideas, and discoveries of seven remarkable mathematicians. It tells the stories of the unsung heroes of the computer age – the logicians.</p><p/><p>The story begins with Leibniz in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and then focuses on Boole, Frege, Cantor, Hilbert, and Gödel, before turning to Turing. Turing’s analysis of algorithmic processes led to a single, all-purpose machine that could be programmed to carry out such processes—the computer. Davis describes how this incredible group, with lives as extraordinary as their accomplishments, grappled with logical reasoning and its mechanization. By investigating their achievements and failures, he shows how these pioneers paved the way for modern computing.</p><p/><p>Bringing the material up to date, in this revised edition Davis discusses the success of the IBM Watson on <em>Jeopardy</em>, reorganizes the information on incompleteness, and adds information on Konrad Zuse. A distinguished prize-winning logician, Martin Davis has had a career of more than six decades devoted to the important interface between logic and computer science. His expertise, combined with his genuine love of the subject and excellent storytelling, make him the perfect person to tell this story.</p></span></span>",

At the same time, it highlights how classic test sets are skewed in favor of different classes of problems, and how, as a result, optimizers that have performed well on test problems may perform poorly in real life scenarios.</p></span>",

It exposes students to mathematical techniques and methods that are practical and relevant to theoretical aspects of computer science.</p><p></p><p>After introducing basic mathematical and combinatorial methods, the text focuses on various aspects of probability, including finite sets, random variables, distributions, Bayes’ theorem, and Chebyshev inequality. It explores the role of recurrences in computer science, numerical analysis, engineering, and discrete mathematics applications. The author then describes the powerful tool of generating functions, which is demonstrated in enumeration problems, such as probabilistic algorithms, compositions and partitions of integers, and shuffling. He also discusses the symbolic method, the principle of inclusion and exclusion, and its applications. The book goes on to show how strings can be manipulated and counted, how the finite state machine and Markov chains can help solve probabilistic and combinatorial problems, how to derive asymptotic results, and how convergence and singularities play leading roles in deducing asymptotic information from generating functions. The final chapter presents the definitions and properties of the mathematical infrastructure needed to accommodate generating functions.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by more than 1,000 examples and exercises, this comprehensive, classroom-tested text develops students’ understanding of the mathematical methodology behind the analysis of algorithms. It emphasizes the important relation between continuous (classical) mathematics and discrete mathematics, which is the basis of computer science.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Web 2.0 applications are best known for providing a rich user experience, but the parts you can't see are just as important-and impressive. Many Web 2.0 applications use powerful techniques to process information intelligently and offer features based on patterns and relationships in the data that couldn't be discovered manually. Successful examples of these Algorithms of the Intelligent Web include household names like Google Ad Sense, Netflix, and Amazon. These applications use the internet as a platform that not only gathers data at an ever-increasing pace but also systematically transforms the raw data into actionable information.</p><p>Algorithms of the Intelligent Web is an example-driven blueprint for creating applications that collect, analyze, and act on the massive quantities of data users leave in their wake as they use the web. You'll learn how to build Amazon- and Netflix-style recommendation engines, and how the same techniques apply to people matches on social-networking sites. See how click-trace analysis can result in smarter ad rotations. With a plethora of examples and extensive detail, this book shows you how to build Web 2.0 applications that are as smart as your users.</p></span>",

It introduces a logical theory of photographic lighting so if you are starting out in photography you will learn how to predict results before setting up lights. This is not primarily a how-to book with only set examples for you to copy. Rather, Light: Science and Magic provides you with a comprehensive theory of the nature and principles of light to allow you to use lighting to express your own creativity.<br id=\"CRLF\"/><br id=\"CRLF\"/>Numerous photographs and illustrations provide clear examples of the theories, while sidebars highlight special lighting questions.  Expanded chapters on available light in portraiture, as well as new information on digital equipment and terminology make this a must have update!</span>",
