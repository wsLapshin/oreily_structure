Beginning with digital logic gates and progressing to the design of combinational and sequential circuits, Harris and Harris use these fundamental building blocks as the basis for what follows: the design of an actual MIPS processor. SystemVerilog and VHDL are integrated throughout the text in examples illustrating the methods and techniques for CAD-based circuit design. By the end of this book, readers will be able to build their own microprocessor and will have a top-to-bottom understanding of how it works. Harris and Harris have combined an engaging and humorous writing style with an updated and hands-on approach to digital design.  <p>This second edition has been updated with new content on I/O systems in the context of general purpose processors found in a PC as well as microcontrollers found almost everywhere. The new edition provides practical examples of how to interface with peripherals using RS232, SPI, motor control, interrupts, wireless, and analog-to-digital conversion. High-level descriptions of I/O interfaces found in PCs include USB, SDRAM, WiFi, PCI Express, and others.

The book, which became a part of Intel's 2012 recommended reading list for developers, covers the revolution of mobile computing. It also highlights the two most important factors in architecture today: parallelism and memory hierarchy.</p><p>This fully updated edition is comprised of six chapters that follow a consistent framework: explanation of the ideas in each chapter; a crosscutting issues section, which presents how the concepts covered in one chapter connect with those given in other chapters; a putting it all together section that links these concepts by discussing how they are applied in real machine; and detailed examples of misunderstandings and architectural traps commonly encountered by developers and architects. Formulas for energy, static and dynamic power, integrated circuit costs, reliability, and availability are included. The book also covers virtual machines, SRAM and DRAM technologies, and new material on Flash memory. Other topics include the exploitation of instruction-level parallelism in high-performance processors, superscalar execution, dynamic scheduling and multithreading, vector architectures, multicore processors, and warehouse-scale computers (WSCs). There are updated case studies and completely new exercises. Additional reference appendices are available online.</p><p>This book will be a valuable reference for computer architects, programmers, application developers, compiler and system software developers, computer system designers and application developers. </p><ul><li>Part of Intel's 2012 Recommended Reading List for Developers</li><li>Updated to cover the mobile computing revolution</li><li>Emphasizes the two most important topics in architecture today: memory hierarchy and parallelism in all its forms.</li><li>Develops common themes throughout each chapter: power, performance, cost, dependability, protection, programming models, and emerging trends (\"What's Next\")</li><li>Includes three review appendices in the printed text.

			"title": "Designing Embedded Hardware, 2nd Edition",
			"description": "<span><div><p>Embedded computer systems literally surround us: they're in our cell phones, PDAs, cars, TVs, refrigerators, heating systems, and more.  In fact, embedded systems are one of the most rapidly growing segments of the computer industry today.Along with the growing list of devices for which embedded computer systems are appropriate, interest is growing among programmers, hobbyists, and engineers of all types in how to design and build devices of their own. Furthermore, the knowledge offered by this book into the fundamentals of these computer systems can benefit anyone who has to evaluate and apply the systems.The second edition of <i>Designing Embedded Hardware</i> has been updated to include information on the latest generation of processors and microcontrollers, including the new MAXQ processor. If you're new to this and don't know what a MAXQ is, don't worry--the book spells out the basics of embedded design for beginners while providing material useful for advanced systems designers.<i>Designing Embedded Hardware</i> steers a course between those books dedicated to writing code for particular microprocessors, and those that stress the philosophy of embedded system design without providing any practical information. Having designed 40 embedded computer systems of his own, author John Catsoulis brings a wealth of real-world experience to show readers how to design and create entirely new embedded devices and computerized gadgets, as well as how to customize and extend off-the-shelf systems.Loaded with real examples, this book also provides a roadmap to the pitfalls and traps to avoid. <i>Designing Embedded Hardware</i> includes:</p><ul><li>The theory and practice of embedded systems</li><li>Understanding schematics and data sheets</li><li>Powering an embedded system</li><li>Producing and debugging an embedded system</li><li>Processors such as the PIC, Atmel AVR, and Motorola 68000-series</li><li>Digital Signal Processing (DSP) architectures</li><li>Protocols (SPI and I2C) used to add peripherals</li><li>RS-232C, RS-422, infrared communication, and USB</li><li>CAN and Ethernet networking</li><li>Pulse Width Monitoring and motor control</li></ul>If you want to build your own embedded system, or tweak an existing one, this invaluable book gives you the understanding and practical skills you need.</div></span>",

Running on a coin-sized battery, BLE can operate reliably for years, connecting and extending everything from personal area network devices to next-generation sensors. Now, one of the standard’s leading developers has written the first comprehensive, accessible introduction to BLE for every system developer, designer, and engineer.</p><p>Robin Heydon, a member of the Bluetooth SIG Hall of Fame, has brought together essential information previously scattered through multiple standards documents, sharing the context and expert insights needed to implement high-performance working systems. He first reviews BLE’s design goals, explaining how they drove key architectural decisions, and introduces BLE’s innovative usage models. Next, he thoroughly covers how the two main parts of BLE, the controller and host, work together, and then addresses key issues from security and profiles through testing and qualification. This knowledge has enabled the creation of Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready devices.</p><p>This guide is an indispensable companion to the official BLE standards documents and is for every technical professional and decision-maker considering BLE, planning BLE products, or transforming plans into working systems.</p><p>Topics Include</p><ul><li><p>BLE device types, design goals, terminology, and core concepts</p></li><li><p>Architecture: controller, host, applications, and stack splits</p></li><li><p>Usage models: presence detection, data broadcasting, connectionless models, and gateways</p></li><li><p>Physical Layer: modulation, frequency band, radio channels, power, tolerance, and range</p></li><li><p>Direct Test Mode: transceiver testing, hardware interfaces, and HCI</p></li><li><p>Link Layer: state machine, packets, channels, broadcasting, encryption, and optimization</p></li><li><p>HCI: physical/logical interfaces, controller setup, and connection management</p></li><li><p>L2CAP: channels and packet structure, and LE signaling channels</p></li><li><p>Attributes: grouping, services, characteristics, and protocols</p></li><li><p>Security: pairing, bonding, and data signing</p></li><li><p>Generic Access Profiles: roles, modes, procedures, security modes, data advertising, and services</p></li><li><p>Applications, devices, services, profiles, and peripherals</p></li><li><p>Testing/qualification: starting projects, selecting features, planning, testing, compliance, and more</p></li></ul></div></span>",

			"title": "Computer System Designs: System-on-Chip",
			"description": "<span><span><span><p>The next generation of computer system designers will be less concerned about details of processors and memories, and more concerned about the elements of a system tailored to particular applications. These designers will have a fundamental knowledge of processors and other elements in the system, but the success of their design will depend on the skills in making system-level tradeoffs that optimize the cost, performance and other attributes to meet application requirements. This book provides a new treatment of computer system design, particularly for System-on-Chip (SOC), which addresses the issues mentioned above. It begins with a global introduction, from the high-level view to the lowest common denominator (the chip itself), then moves on to the three main building blocks of an SOC (processor, memory, and interconnect). Next is an overview of what makes SOC unique (its customization ability and the applications that drive it). The final chapter presents future challenges for system design and SOC possibilities.</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>\nThis book will explain how to verify SoC (Systems on Chip) logic designs using “formal and “semiformal verification techniques. The critical issue to be addressed is whether the functionality of the design is the one that the designers intended. Simulation has been used for checking the correctness of SoC designs (as in “functional verification), but many subtle design errors cannot be caught by simulation. Recently, formal verification, giving mathematical proof of the correctness of designs, has been gaining popularity.<br/><br/>For higher design productivity, it is essential to debug designs as early as possible, which this book facilitates. This book covers all aspects of high-level formal and semiformal verification techniques for system level designs.<br/><br/>• First book that covers all aspects of formal and semiformal, high-level (higher than RTL) design verification targeting SoC designs.<br/>• Formal verification of high-level designs (RTL or higher).<br/>• Verification techniques are discussed with associated system-level design methodology.\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Using FreeRTOS and libopencm3 instead of the Arduino software environment, this book will help you develop multi-tasking applications that go beyond Arduino norms. In addition to the usual peripherals found in the typical Arduino device, the STM32 device includes a USB controller, RTC (Real Time Clock), DMA (Direct Memory Access controller), CAN bus and more. </p><p>Each chapter contains clear explanations of the STM32 hardware capabilities to help get you started with the device, including GPIO and several other ST Microelectronics peripherals like USB and CAN bus controller. You’ll learn how to download and set up the libopencm3 + FreeRTOS development environment, using GCC. With everything set up, you’ll leverage FreeRTOS to create tasks, queues, and mutexes. You’ll also learn to work with the I2C bus to add GPIO using the PCF8574 chip. And how to create PWM output for RC control using hardware timers.</p>You'll be introduced to new concepts that are necessary to master the STM32, such as how to extend code with GCC overlays using an external Winbond ​W25Q32 flash chip. Your knowledge is tested at the end of each chapter with exercises. Upon completing this book, you’ll be ready to work with any of the devices in the STM32 family. <div><i><br/></i></div><div><i>Beginning STM32</i> provides the professional, student, or hobbyist a way to learn about ARM without costing an arm!<div><p></p><div><b>What You'll Learn</b></div><ul><li>Initialize and use the libopencm3 drivers and handle interrupts<br/></li><li>Use DMA to drive a SPI based OLED displaying an analog meter<br/></li><li>Read PWM from an RC control using hardware timers<br/></li></ul><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Experienced embedded engineers, students, hobbyists and makers wishing to explore the ARM architecture, going beyond Arduino limits.<br/></div></div></div></span>",

This leads to software that is fragile in terms of extensibility and difficult to test without fully integrated software and hardware. <i>Patterns in the Machine</i> focuses on creating loosely coupled implementations that embrace both change and testability.</p><p>This book illustrates how implementing continuous integration, automated unit testing, platform-independent code, and other best practices that are not typically implemented in the embedded systems world is not just feasible but also practical for today’s embedded projects.</p><p>After reading this book, you will have a better idea of how to structure your embedded software projects. You will recognize that while writing unit tests, creating simulators, and implementing continuous integration requires time and effort up front, you will be amply rewarded at the end of the project in terms of quality, adaptability, and maintainability of your code. </p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li> Incorporate automated unit      testing into an embedded project</li><li>Design and build functional      simulators for an embedded project</li><li>Write production-quality      software when hardware is not available</li><li>Use the Data Model      architectural pattern to create a highly decoupled design and implementation</li><li>Understand the importance of      defining the software architecture before implementation starts and      how to do it</li><li>Discover why documentation      is essential for an embedded project</li><li>Use finite state machines in      embedded projects</li></ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>\n\nMid-level or higher embedded systems (firmware) developers, technical leads, software architects, and development managers.</span>",

			"description": "<span>\nOver the last ten years, the ARM architecture has become one of the most pervasive architectures in the world, with more than 2 billion ARM-based processors embedded in products ranging from cell phones to automotive braking systems. A world-wide community of ARM developers in semiconductor and product design companies includes software developers, system designers and hardware engineers. To date no book has directly addressed their need to develop the system and software for an ARM-based system. This text fills that gap. <br/><br/>This book provides a comprehensive description of the operation of the ARM core from a developer’s perspective with a clear emphasis on software. It demonstrates not only how to write efficient ARM software in C and assembly but also how to optimize code. Example code throughout the book can be integrated into commercial products or used as templates to enable quick creation of productive software. <br/><br/>The book covers both the ARM and Thumb instruction sets, covers Intel's XScale Processors, outlines distinctions among the versions of the ARM architecture, demonstrates how to implement DSP algorithms, explains exception and interrupt handling, describes the cache technologies that surround the ARM cores as well as the most efficient memory management techniques. A final chapter looks forward to the future of the ARM architecture considering ARMv6, the latest change to the instruction set, which has been designed to improve the DSP and media processing capabilities of the architecture.<br/><br/>* No other book describes the ARM core from a system and software perspective. <br/>* Author team combines extensive ARM software engineering experience with an in-depth knowledge of ARM developer needs. <br/>* Practical, executable code is fully explained in the book and available on the publisher's Website. <br/>* Includes a simple embedded operating system.\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><span><p>As digital circuit elements decrease in physical size, resulting in increasingly complex systems, a basic logic model that can be used in the control and design of a range of semiconductor devices is vital. Finite State Machines (FSM) have numerous advantages; they can be applied to many areas (including motor control, and signal and serial data identification to name a few) and they use less logic than their alternatives, leading to the development of faster digital hardware systems.</p><p>This clear and logical book presents a range of novel techniques for the rapid and reliable design of digital systems using FSMs, detailing exactly how and where they can be implemented.   With a practical approach, it covers synchronous and asynchronous FSMs in the design of both simple and complex systems, and Petri-Net design techniques for sequential/parallel control systems. Chapters on Hardware Description Language cover the widely-used and powerful Verilog HDL in sufficient detail to facilitate the description and verification of FSMs, and FSM based systems, at both the gate and behavioural levels.</p><p>Throughout, the text incorporates many real-world examples that demonstrate designs such as data acquisition, a memory tester, and passive serial data monitoring and detection, among others. A useful accompanying CD offers working Verilog software tools for the capture and simulation of design solutions.</p><p>With a linear programmed learning format, this book works as a concise guide for the practising digital designer. This book will also be of importance to senior students and postgraduates of electronic engineering, who require design skills for the embedded systems market.</p><p><b>Note: The ebook version does not provide access to the companion files.</b></p></span></span></span></span>",

Such systems typically consist of a heterogeneous collection of processors, specialized memory subsystems, and partially programmable or fixed-function components.

With an emphasis on real-world examples, the text explains how distributed circuits using microstrip and other planar transmission lines can be designed and fabricated for use in modern high-frequency passive and active circuits and sub-systems. The authors provide clear and accurate guidance on each essential aspect of circuit design, from the theory of transmission lines to the passive and active circuits that form the basis of modern high-frequency circuits and sub-systems. </p><p>Assuming a basic grasp of electronic concepts, the book is organized around first principles and includes an extensive set of worked examples to guide student readers with no prior grounding in the subject of high-frequency microwave technology. Throughout the text, detailed coverage of practical design using distributed circuits demonstrates the influence of modern fabrication processes. Filling a significant gap in literature by addressing RF and microwave circuit design with a central theme of planar distributed circuits, this textbook: </p><ul><li>Provides comprehensive discussion of the foundational concepts of RF and microwave transmission lines introduced through an exploration of wave propagation along a typical transmission line</li><li>Describes fabrication processes for RF and microwave circuits, including etched, thick-film, and thin-film RF circuits</li><li>Covers the Smith Chart and its application in circuit design, S-parameters, Mason???s non-touching loop rule, transducer power gain, and stability</li><li>Discusses the influence of noise in high-frequency circuits and low-noise amplifier design</li><li>Features an introduction to the design of high-frequency planar antennas </li><li>Contains supporting chapters on fabrication, circuit parameters, and measurements</li><li>Includes access to a companion website with PowerPoint slides for instructors, as well as supplementary resources</li></ul><p>Perfect for senior undergraduate students and first-year graduate students in electrical engineering courses, <i>RF and Microwave Circuit Design: Theory and Applications</i> will also earn a place in the libraries of RF and microwave professionals looking for a useful reference to refresh their understanding of fundamental concepts in the field.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>With the growing complexity of personal mobile communication systems demanding higher data-rates and high levels of integration using low-cost CMOS technology, overall system performance has become more sensitive to RF analog front-end impairments. Designing integrated transceivers requires a thorough understanding of the whole transceiver chain including RF analog front-end and digital baseband. Communication system engineers have to include RF analog imperfections in their simulation benches in order to study and quantify their impact on the system performance.</p><p>Here the author explores key RF analog impairments in a transceiver and demonstrates how to model their impact from a communication system design view-point. He discusses the design aspects of the front end of transceivers (both receivers and transmitters) and provides the reader with a way to optimize a complex mixed-signal platform by taking into account the characteristics of the RF/analog front-end.</p><p>Key features of this book include:</p><li><p>Practical examples illustrated by system simulation results based on WiFi and mobile WiMAX OFDM transceivers</p></li><li><p>An overview of the digital estimation and compensation of the RF analog impairments such as power amplifier distortion, quadrature imbalance, and carrier and sampling frequency offsets</p></li><li><p>An exposition of the challenges involved in the design of both RF analog circuits and DSP communication circuits in deep submicron CMOS technology</p></li><li><p>MATLAB codes for RF analog impairments models  hosted on the companion website</p></li><p>Uniquely the book bridges the gap between RFIC design specification needs and communication systems simulation, offering readers RF analog impairments modeling knowledge and a comprehensive approach to unifying theory and practice in system modelling. It is of great value to communication systems and DSP engineers and graduate students who design communication processing engines, RF/analog systems and IC design engineers involved in the design of communication platforms.</p></span></span></span>",

Featuring examples of the two most widely-used HDLs, VHDL and Verilog, the first half of the text prepares the reader for what follows in the second: the design of a MIPS Processor. By the end of Digital Design and Computer Architecture, readers will be able to build their own microprocessor and will have a top-to-bottom understanding of how it works--even if they have no formal background in design or architecture beyond an introductory class. David Harris and Sarah Harris combine an engaging and humorous writing style with an updated and hands-on approach to digital design.<br/><br/>· Unique presentation of digital logic design from the perspective of computer architecture using a real instruction set, MIPS.<br/>· Side-by-side examples of the two most prominent Hardware Design Languages--VHDL and Verilog--illustrate and compare the ways the each can be used in the design of digital systems.<br/>· Worked examples conclude each section to enhance the reader's understanding and retention of the material.<br/>· Companion Web site includes links to CAD tools for FPGA design from Xilinx, lecture slides, laboratory projects, and solutions to exercises.</span>",

Accessible 3D printing introduced the masses to computer-controlled additive fabrication. But the flip side of that is subtractive fabrication: instead of adding material to create a shape like a 3D printer does, a CNC starts with a solid piece of material and takes away from it. Although inexpensive 3D printers can make great things with plastic, a CNC can carve highly durable pieces out of a block of aluminum, wood, and other materials. This book covers the fundamentals of designing for--and working with--affordable ($500-$3000) CNCs.</p></span>",

The sector shall make incremental progress as it learns from associations between data over time through Artificial Intelligence, deep learning and Internet of Things applications. The farming industry and Smart agriculture develop from the stringent limits imposed by a farm's location, which in turn has a series of related effects with respect to supply chain management, food availability, biodiversity, farmers' decision-making and insurance, and environmental concerns among others. All of the above-mentioned aspects will derive substantial benefits from the implementation of a data-driven approach under the condition that the systems, tools and techniques to be used have been designed to handle the volume and variety of the data to be gathered. Contributions to this book have been solicited with the goal of uncovering the possibilities of engaging agriculture with equipped and effective profound learning algorithms. Most agricultural research centres are already adopting Internet of Things for the monitoring of a wide range of farm services, and there are significant opportunities for agriculture administration through the effective implementation of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data and IoT structures.</p></span>",

All explanations rely on the use of open source and free software packages. By presenting how to build the operating system components from pristine sources and how to find more documentation or help, this book greatly simplifies the task of keeping complete control over one's embedded operating system, whether it be for technical or sound financial reasons.Author Karim Yaghmour, a well-known designer and speaker who is responsible for the Linux Trace Toolkit, starts by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of Linux as an embedded operating system. Licensing issues are included, followed by a discussion of the basics of building embedded Linux systems. The configuration, setup, and use of over forty different open source and free software packages commonly used in embedded Linux systems are also covered. uClibc, BusyBox, U-Boot, OpenSSH, thttpd, tftp, strace, and gdb are among the packages discussed.</div></span></span>",

If you want to know what does this bit\ncontrol, what does that feature do, and how did those instructions\nevolve through several generations of x86, this is the reference\nbook for you. This is the book Intel should have written, but now\nthey don’t have to.”</p><p>\n         —<b>Bob\nColwell</b>, Intel Fellow</p><p><b><em>The Unabridged Pentium 4</em></b> offers unparalleled\ncoverage of Intel’s IA32 family of processors, from the 386\nthrough the Pentium 4 and Pentium M processors. Unlike other texts,\nwhich address solely a hardware or software audience, this book\nserves as a comprehensive technical reference for both audiences.\nInside, Tom Shanley covers not only the hardware design and\nsoftware enhancements of Intel’s latest processors, he also\nexplains the relationship between these hardware and software\ncharacteristics. As a result, readers will come away with a\ncomplete understanding of the processor’s internal\narchitecture, the Front Side Bus (FSB), the processor’s\nrelationship to the system, and the processor’s software\narchitecture.</p><p>Essential topics covered include:</p><li><p>Goals of single-task and multi-task operating systems</p></li><li><p>The 386 processor—the baseline ancestor of the IA32\nprocessor family</p></li><li><p>The 486 processor, including a cache primer</p></li><li><p>The Pentium processor</p></li><li><p>The P6 roadmap, P6 processor core, and P6 FSB</p></li><li><p>The Pentium Pro processor, including the Microcode Update\nfeature</p></li><li><p>The Pentium II and the Pentium II Xeon and Celeron\nprocessors</p></li><li><p>The Pentium III and the Pentium III Xeon and Celeron\nprocessors</p></li><li><p>The Pentium 4 processor family</p></li><li><p>The Pentium M processor</p></li><li><p>Processor identification, System Management Mode, and the IO\nand Local APICs</p></li><p>An “at-a-glance” table of contents allows readers to\nquickly find topics ranging from 386 Demand Mode Paging to Pentium\n4 CPU Arbitration.</p><p>The accompanying CD-ROM contains 16 extra chapters.</p><p>Whether you design software or hardware or are responsible for\nsystem maintenance or customer support, <em><b>The Unabridged\nPentium 4</b></em> will prove an invaluable reference to the\nworld’s most widely used microprocessor chips.</p><p>MindShare’s PC System Architecture series is a crisply\nwritten and comprehensive set of guides to the most important PC\nhardware standards. Books in the series are intended for use by\nhardware and software designers, programmers, and support\npersonnel.</p><p>One of the leading technical training companies in the hardware\nindustry, MindShare, Inc., provides innovative courses for dozens\nof companies, including HP, AMD, IBM, and Compaq. Through these\nclasses and by writing the highly regarded PC System Architecture\nSeries for Addison-Wesley, MindShare trainers emphasize the\nrelationships of hardware subsystems to each other as well as the\nrelationship between software and hardware.</p></span></span></span></span>",

These could include electrical engineers or computer programmers who want to get started with microcontroller applications using the ARM Cortex-M4 architecture in a short time frame. The book's recipes can also be used to support students learning embedded programming for the first time. Basic knowledge of programming using a high level language is essential but those familiar with other high level languages such as Python or Java should not have too much difficulty picking up the basics of embedded C programming.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Use ARM's uVision MDK to configure the microcontroller run time environment (RTE), create projects and compile download and run simple programs on an evaluation board.</li><li>Use and extend device family packs to configure I/O peripherals.</li><li>Develop multimedia applications using the touchscreen and audio codec beep generator.</li><li>Configure the codec to stream digital audio and design digital filters to create amazing audio effects.</li><li>Write multi-threaded programs using ARM's real time operating system (RTOS).</li><li>Write critical sections of code in assembly language and integrate these with functions written in C.</li><li>Fix problems using ARM's debugging tool to set breakpoints and examine variables.</li><li>Port uVision projects to other open source development environments.</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Embedded microcontrollers are at the core of many everyday electronic devices. Electronic automotive systems rely on these devices for engine management, anti-lock brakes, in car entertainment, automatic transmission, active suspension, satellite navigation, etc. The so-called internet of things drives the market for such technology, so much so that embedded cores now represent 90% of all processor's sold. The ARM Cortex-M4 is one of the most powerful microcontrollers on the market and includes a floating point unit (FPU) which enables it to address applications.</p><p>The ARM Cortex-M4 Microcontroller Cookbook provides a practical introduction to programming an embedded microcontroller architecture. This book attempts to address this through a series of recipes that develop embedded applications targeting the ARM-Cortex M4 device family. The recipes in this book have all been tested using the Keil MCBSTM32F400 board. This board includes a small graphic LCD touchscreen (320x240 pixels) that can be used to create a variety of 2D gaming applications. These motivate a younger audience and are used throughout the book to illustrate particular hardware peripherals and software concepts.</p><p>C language is used predominantly throughout but one chapter is devoted to recipes involving assembly language. Programs are mostly written using ARM's free microcontroller development kit (MDK) but for those looking for open source development environments the book also shows how to configure the ARM-GNU toolchain. Some of the recipes described in the book are the basis for laboratories and assignments undertaken by undergraduates.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>The ARM Cortex-M4 Cookbook is a practical guide full of hands-on recipes. It follows a step-by-step approach that allows you to find, utilize and learn ARM concepts quickly.</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

			"title": "Reversing Urban Decline, 2nd Edition",
			"description": "<span><p>Detroit’s bankruptcy is the most severe example of the financial implications of the movement of wealth to the suburbs. When residents and businesses leave, central cities have a disproportionate share of most regions’ lower-income households. At the same time, many central cities collect less revenue as states cut financial support. So, we are left with the question: can central cities change patterns of economic activity? In <b>Reversing Urban Decline: Why and How Sports, Entertainment, and Culture Turn Cities into Major League Winners, Second Edition</b> author Mark Rosentraub details how central cities facing increasing levels of economic segregation can use new urban areas anchored by sports venues to enhance their financial position.</p><b>\n</b><p>See What’s New in the Second Edition:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Increased focus on urban revitalization, urban theory, and urban planning</li><li>Two additional case studies (Denver and Fort Wayne) to give the book a broader appeal and more material to make the book a good fit for urban planning, urban studies, and public policy classes</li><li>New data based on additional research and follow up on several of the original cases</li><p/></ul><p>Rosentraub anchors the book more closely in the center of the debate on urban revitalization, the financial issues facing central cities, and the ways in which public leaders can respond to the economic segregation developing between central cities and their suburban areas. That disparity is reducing the taxes that central cities receive, reducing their ability to provide the services residents need. </p><p>Rather than just provide us with a brief escape from our problems, sports and entertainment, with the right leadership, can create opportunities for our cities to reinvent and reinvigorate themselves. Placing sports as one of the central elements to revitalize urban centers, this book uses several case studies to develop a set of rules to help cities plan for the effective use and returns from their investments in sports, entertainment, and cultural centers.</p></span>",

			"title": "Advanced DC/AC Inverters",
			"description": "<span><p>DC/AC inversion technology is of vital importance for industrial applications, including electrical vehicles and renewable energy systems, which require a large number of inverters. In recent years, inversion technology has developed rapidly, with new topologies improving the power factor and increasing power efficiency. Proposing many novel approaches, <strong>Advanced DC/AC Inverters: Applications in Renewable Energy </strong>describes advanced DC/AC inverters that can be used for renewable energy systems. The book introduces more than 100 topologies of advanced inverters originally developed by the authors, including more than 50 new circuits. It also discusses recently published cutting-edge topologies.</p><p><strong><em>Novel PWM and Multilevel Inverters</em></strong></p><p>The book first covers traditional pulse-width-modulation (PWM) inverters before moving on to new quasi-impedance source inverters and soft-switching PWM inverters. It then examines multilevel DC/AC inverters, which have overcome the drawbacks of PWM inverters and provide greater scope for industrial applications. The authors propose four novel multilevel inverters: laddered multilevel inverters, super-lift modulated inverters, switched-capacitor inverters, and switched-inductor inverters. With simple structures and fewer components, these inverters are well suited for renewable energy systems.</p><p><strong><em>Get the Best Switching Angles for Any Multilevel Inverter</em></strong></p><p>A key topic for multilevel inverters is the need to manage the switching angles to obtain the lowest total harmonic distortion (THD). The authors outline four methods for finding the best switching angles and use simulation waveforms to verify the design. The optimum switching angles for multilevel DC/AC inverters are also listed in tables for quick reference.</p><p><strong><em>Application Examples of DC/AC Inverters in Renewable Energy Systems</em></strong></p><p>Highlighting the importance of inverters in improving energy saving and power-supply quality, the final chapter of the book supplies design examples for applications in wind turbine and solar panel energy systems. Written by pioneers in advanced conversion and inversion technology, this book guides readers in designing more effective DC/AC inverters for use in renewable energy systems.</p></span>",

We are on the leading edge of a Smart Machine Age led by artificial intelligence that will be as transformative for us as the Industrial Revolution was for our ancestors. Smart machines will take over millions of jobs in manufacturing, office work, the service sector, the professions, you name it. Not only can they know more data and analyze it faster than any mere human, say Edward Hess and Katherine Ludwig, but smart machines are free of the emotional, psychological, and cultural baggage that so often mars human thinking. <br/><br/>So we can't beat 'em and we can't join 'em. To stay relevant, we have to play a different game. Hess and Ludwig offer us that game plan. We need to excel at critical, creative, and innovative thinking and at genuinely engaging with others—things machines can't do well. The key is to change our definition of what it means to be smart. Hess and Ludwig call it being NewSmart. In this extraordinarily timely book, they offer detailed guidance for developing NewSmart attitudes and four critical behaviors that will help us adapt to the new reality. <br/><br/>The crucial mindset underlying NewSmart is humility—not self-effacement but an accurate self-appraisal: acknowledging you can't have all the answers, remaining open to new ideas, and committing yourself to lifelong learning. Drawing on extensive multidisciplinary research, Hess and Ludwig emphasize that the key to success in this new era is not to be more like the machines but to excel at the best of what makes us human. \n  </span>",

An Introduction to Practical Formal Methods Using Temporal Logic provides an introduction to formal methods based on temporal logic, for developing and testing complex computational systems. These methods are supported by many well-developed tools, techniques and results that can be applied to a wide range of systems.</p><p>Fisher begins with a full introduction to the subject, covering the basics of temporal logic and using a variety of examples, exercises and pointers to more advanced work to help clarify and illustrate the topics discussed. He goes on to describe how this logic can be used to specify a variety of computational systems, looking at issues of linking specifications, concurrency, communication and composition ability. He then analyses temporal specification techniques such as deductive verification, algorithmic verification, and direct execution to develop and verify computational systems. The final chapter on case studies analyses the potential problems that can occur in a range of engineering applications in the areas of robotics, railway signalling, hardware design, ubiquitous computing, intelligent agents, and information security, and explains how temporal logic can improve their accuracy and reliability.</p><ul><li><p>Models temporal notions and uses them to analyze computational systems</p></li><li><p>Provides a broad approach to temporal logic across many formal methods - including specification, verification and implementation</p></li><li><p>Introduces and explains freely available tools based on temporal logics and shows how these can be applied</p></li><li><p>Presents exercises and pointers to further study in each chapter, as well as an accompanying website providing links to additional systems based upon temporal logic as well as additional material related to the book.</p></li></ul></span></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>\nThe fact that there are more embedded computers than general-purpose computers and that we are impacted by hundreds of them every day is no longer news.  What is news is that their increasing performance requirements, complexity and capabilities demand a new approach to their design.  <br/><br/>Fisher, Faraboschi, and Young describe a new age of embedded computing design, in which the processor is central, making the approach radically distinct from contemporary practices of embedded systems design.  They demonstrate why it is essential to take a computing-centric and system-design approach to the traditional elements of nonprogrammable components, peripherals, interconnects and buses.  These elements must be unified in a system design with high-performance processor architectures, microarchitectures and compilers, and with the compilation tools, debuggers and simulators needed for application development. <br/><br/>In this landmark text, the authors apply their expertise in highly interdisciplinary hardware/software development and VLIW processors to illustrate this change in embedded computing.  VLIW architectures have long been a popular choice in embedded systems design, and while VLIW is a running theme throughout the book, embedded computing is the core topic. Embedded Computing examines both in a book filled with fact and opinion based on the authors many years of R&amp;D experience.<br/><br/>· Complemented by a unique, professional-quality embedded tool-chain on the authors' website, http://www.vliw.org/book<br/>· Combines technical depth with real-world experience <br/>· Comprehensively explains the differences between general purpose computing systems and embedded systems at the hardware, software, tools and operating system levels. <br/>· Uses concrete examples to explain and motivate the trade-offs.\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Today's digital cameras continue to produce increasingly higher definition image data files, making high resolution, large-format output possible. As printing technology moves forward at an equally fast pace, the new inkjet printers are capable of printing with great precision at a very fine resolution, providing an amazing tonal range and significantly superior image permanence at a more affordable price. In the hands of knowledgeable photographers, these printers are able to produce prints that are comparable to the highest quality darkroom prints on fine art paper. <br/><br/>The third edition of this best-selling book provides the necessary foundation for successful fine art printing: the understanding of color management, profiling, paper, and inks. It offers advice on selecting an appropriate printer for long-lasting fine art prints, demonstrates how to set up the printing workflow and select a suitable paper for your subject, and guides you step-by-step through the process of converting an image file to an outstanding fine art print. <br/><br/>This new edition covers the most recent lines of high-end inkjet printers, photo papers, and devices for monitor and printer profiling. It also addresses the printing dialogs and some new features of Photoshop CS6.</p></span>",

If your business needs to make\nquick, accurate decisions on an industrialized scale, you need to\nread this book.”</p><p><em>Thomas H. Davenport, Professor, Babson\nCollege, Author of</em> Competing on Analytics</p><p>The computer-based systems most\norganizations rely on to support their businesses are not very\nsmart. Many of the business decisions these companies make tend to\nbe hidden in systems that make poor decisions, or don’t make\nthem at all. Further, most systems struggle to keep up with the\npace of change.</p><p>The answer is not to implement newer,\n“intelligent” systems. The fact is that much of\ntoday’s existing technology has the potential to be\n“smart enough” to make a big difference to an\norganization’s business. This book tells you how.</p><p>Although the business context and underlying\nprinciples are explained in a nontechnical manner, the book also\ncontains how-to guidance for more technical readers.</p><p>The book’s companion site,\nwww.smartenoughsystems.com, has additional information and\nreferences for practitioners as well as news and updates.</p><p><b>Additional Praise for <em>Smart (Enough)\nSystems</em></b></p><p>“James Taylor and Neil Raden are on to\nsomething important in this book–the tremendous value of\nimproving the large number of routine decisions that are made in\norganizations every day.”</p><p><em>Dr. Hugh J.

			"description": "<span><p>As advances in technology and circuit design boost operating frequencies of microprocessors, DSPs and other fast chips, new design challenges continue to emerge. One of the major performance limitations in today's chip designs is clock skew, the uncertainty in arrival times between a pair of clocks. Increasing clock frequencies are forcing many engineers to rethink their timing budgets and to use skew-tolerant circuit techniques for both domino and static circuits. While senior designers have long developed their own techniques for reducing the sequencing overhead of domino circuits, this knowledge has routinely been protected as trade secret and has rarely been shared. <i>Skew-Tolerant Circuit Design</i> presents a systematic way of achieving the same goal and puts it in the hands of all designers.  This book clearly presents skew-tolerant techniques and shows how they address the challenges of clocking, latching, and clock skew. It provides the practicing circuit designer with a clearly detailed tutorial and an insightful summary of the most recent literature on these critical clock skew issues.</p><ul><li>Synthesizes the most recent advances in skew-tolerant design in one cohesive tutorial</li><li>Provides incisive instruction and advice punctuated by humorous illustrations</li><li>Includes exercises to test understanding of key concepts and solutions to selected exercises</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><strong>From the Foreword: </strong></p><p><strong><em>\"…the presentation of real-time scheduling is probably the best in terms of clarity I have ever read in the professional literature. Easy to understand, which is important for busy professionals keen to acquire (or refresh) new knowledge without being bogged down in a convoluted narrative and an excessive detail overload. The authors managed to largely avoid theoretical-only presentation of the subject, which frequently affects books on operating systems. </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>… an indispensable [resource] to gain a thorough understanding of the real-time systems from the operating systems perspective, and to stay up to date with the recent trends and actual developments of the open-source real-time operating systems.\"</em></strong></p><p>—Richard Zurawski, ISA Group, San Francisco, California, USA<br/></p><p/><p>Real-time embedded systems are integral to the global technological and social space, but references still rarely offer professionals the sufficient mix of theory and practical examples required to meet intensive economic, safety, and other demands on system development. Similarly, instructors have lacked a resource to help students fully understand the field. The information was out there, though often at the abstract level, fragmented and scattered throughout literature from different engineering disciplines and computing sciences. </p><p>Accounting for readers’ varying practical needs and experience levels, <strong>Real Time Embedded Systems: Open-Source Operating Systems Perspective</strong> offers a holistic overview from the operating-systems perspective. It provides a long-awaited reference on real-time operating systems and their almost boundless application potential in the embedded system domain. </p><p>Balancing the already abundant coverage of operating systems with the largely ignored real-time aspects, or \"physicality,\" the authors analyze several realistic case studies to introduce vital theoretical material. They also discuss popular open-source operating systems—<em>Linux</em> and <em>FreRTOS</em>, in particular—to help embedded-system designers identify the benefits and weaknesses in deciding whether or not to adopt more traditional, less powerful, techniques for a project.</p></span>",

For extended use of sensors in industrial production tools and consumer components, such as smart cars and smart homes, the reliability of the sensors should be improved and the cost dramatically reduced. The improvement of reliability, together with a reduction of cost, can only be achieved with smart sensor systems.</p><p>These systems combine the functions of sensors and interfaces, including sensors, signal conditioning A-D (analog to digital) conversion, and bus interfacing. Also, applications at a higher hierarchical level are included, such as self-testing, auto-calibration, data evaluation and identification. Developments into the integration of sensors with electronic circuitry to produce smart sensors and smart sensor systems are increasing as research in this field continues to expand.</p><p>Written by an internationally-recognized team of experts, this book reviews recent developments in the field of smart sensor systems, providing complete coverage of all important system aspects. It takes a multidisciplinary approach to the understanding, design and use of smart sensor systems, their building blocks and methods of signal processing. This book also contains:</p><ul><li><p>a review of powerful measurement techniques, and basic principles and typical problems of sensor elements, smart analog interfaces and A-D converters;</p></li><li><p>a discussion about how to use microcontrollers and DSPs (digital signal processors) for sensor applications;</p></li><li><p>detailed up-to-date reviews of the features of optical, integrated hall magnetic, capacitive, thermal sensors, and temperature sensors and physical chemosensors;</p></li><li><p>numerous case studies and problems set at the end of each chapter to test and develop your knowledge on the theory.

Two critical design aspects for analog and power integrated circuits are combined. The first design aspect covers analog circuit design techniques to achieve the desired circuit performance. The second and main aspect presents the additional challenges associated with the design of adequate and effective ESD protection elements and schemes. A comprehensive list of practical application examples is used to demonstrate the successful combination of both techniques and any potential design trade-offs. </p><p>Chapter One looks at analog design discipline, including layout and analog matching and analog layout design practices. Chapter Two discusses  analog design with circuits, examining: single transistor amplifiers; multi-transistor amplifiers; active loads and more. The third chapter covers analog design layout (also MOSFET layout), before Chapters Four and Five discuss analog design synthesis. The next chapters introduce the reader to analog-digital mixed signal design synthesis, analog signal pin ESD networks, and analog ESD power clamps. Chapter Nine, the last chapter, covers ESD design in analog applications.</p><ul><li>Clearly describes analog design fundamentals (circuit fundamentals) as well as outlining the various ESD implications</li><li>Covers a large breadth of subjects and technologies, such as CMOS, LDMOS, BCD, SOI, and thick body SOI</li><li>Establishes an “ESD analog design” discipline that distinguishes itself from the alternative ESD digital design focus</li><li>Focuses on circuit and circuit design applications</li><li>Assessible, with the artwork and tutorial style of the ESD book series</li><li>PowerPoint slides are available for university faculty members</li></ul><p>Even in the world of digital circuits, analog and power circuits are two very important but under-addressed topics, especially from the ESD aspect.  Dr. Voldman’s new book will serve as an essential and practical guide to the greater IC community. With high practical and academic values this book is a “bible” for professionals, graduate students, device and circuit designers for investigating the physics of ESD and for product designs and testing. </p></span>",

Helping people develop their potential—enabling them to articulate and become the self they want to be, are capable of being, and that best serves them and others in the short and long term—is what we as individuals and leaders strive toward.</p><p>But how do we grow? It turns out it happens in a predictable way, which means we can understand where we are in our growth and chart a way forward. In this compact, complete guide, Whitney Johnson dives more deeply than ever into the S Curve of Learning so that you can envision how growth happens and direct yourself and others in your organization to create a culture that fosters it.</p><p>The growth and learning journey comes in three phases: the Launch Point, the Sweet Spot, and Mastery. Compelling examples of successful people will show you when and why growth is slow, how to keep going, what to do when growth and learning are almost too fast to keep up with, and how to leap from one growth journey to another.</p><p>As individuals grow, so do organizations and societies. Growth is learning put into action—action that betters the world as we better ourselves and our small niches, both personal and professional, within it. Growth occurs when learning is internalized—when we try something new and invest the effort to move it from being something we <i>do</i> to something we <i>are</i>.</p></span>",

It is clear to most urban planners and developers that accommodating the needs of the tens of millions of inhabitants of those megalopolises in an orderly and uninterrupted manner will require the seamless integration of and real-time monitoring and response services for public utilities and transportation systems. Part speculative look into the future of the world’s urban centers, part technical blueprint, this visionary book helps lay the groundwork for the communication networks and services on which tomorrow’s “smart cities” will run.</p> Written by a uniquely well-qualified author team, this book provides detailed insights into the technical requirements for the wireless sensor and actuator networks required to make smart cities a reality.\n   \n  </span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>High-speed, power-efficient analog integrated circuits can be used as standalone devices or to interface modern digital signal processors and micro-controllers in various applications, including multimedia, communication, instrumentation, and control systems. New architectures and low device geometry of complementary metaloxidesemiconductor (CMOS) technologies have accelerated the movement toward system on a chip design, which merges analog circuits with digital, and radio-frequency components. <strong>CMOS: Analog Integrated Circuits: High-Speed and Power-Efficient Design </strong>describes the important trends in designing these analog circuits and provides a complete, in-depth examination of design techniques and circuit architectures, emphasizing practical aspects of integrated circuit implementation.</p><p>Focusing on designing and verifying analog integrated circuits, the author reviews design techniques for more complex components such as amplifiers, comparators, and multipliers. The book details all aspects, from specification to the final chip, of the development and implementation process of filters, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), digital-to-analog converters (DACs), phase-locked loops (PLLs), and delay-locked loops (DLLs). It also describes different equivalent transistor models, design and fabrication considerations for high-density integrated circuits in deep-submicrometer process, circuit structures for the design of current mirrors and voltage references, topologies of suitable amplifiers, continuous-time and switched-capacitor circuits, modulator architectures, and approaches to improve linearity of Nyquist converters. The text addresses the architectures and performance limitation issues affecting circuit operation and provides conceptual and practical solutions to problems that can arise in the design process.</p><p>This reference provides balanced　coverage of theoretical and practical issues that will allow the reader to design CMOS analog integrated circuits with improved electrical performance. The chapters contain easy-to-follow mathematical derivations of all equations and formulas, graphical plots, and open-ended design problems to help determine most suitable architecture for a given set of performance specifications. This comprehensive and illustrative text for the design and analysis of CMOS analog integrated circuits serves as a valuable resource for analog circuit designers and graduate students in electrical engineering.</p></span></span>",

Packed with illustrations and step-by-step walkthroughs.</p><ul><li>Dig deep into Simulink</li><li>No unnecessary theory - start modelling right away</li><li>Complex concepts made easy through examples</li><li>Packed with illustrations and detailed step-by-step walkthroughs</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>Simulink is an engineer's Swiss army knife: instead of spending the day typing out complex formulas, Simulink enables you to both draw and execute them. Block after block, you can develop your ideas without struggling with obscure programming languages and you don't have to wait to debug your algorithm - just launch a simulation!</p><p>Getting Started with Simulink will give you comprehensive knowledge of Simulink's capabilities. From the humble constant block to the S-function block, you will have a clear understanding of what modelling really means, without feeling that something has been left out. By the time you close the book, you'll be able to further extend your modelling skills without any help.</p><p>We''ll start with a brief introduction, and immediately start placing the first blocks. Little by little, you'll build a car cruise controller model, followed by the mathematical model of a sports car in order to calibrate it. Then you'll learn how to interface your Simulink model with the external world. This book will give you an easy understanding of the tools Simulink offers you, guiding you through a complex exercise split into the three main phases of Simulink development: modelling, testing, and interfacing.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><ul><li>This derivative volume stemming from content included in our seminal Power Electronics Handbook takes its chapters related to renewables and establishes them at the core of a new volume dedicated to the increasingly pivotal and as yet under-published intersection of Power Electronics and Alternative Energy. While this re-versioning provides a corollary revenue stream to better leverage our core handbook asset, it does more than simply re-package existing content. Each chapter will be significantly updated and expanded by more than 50%, and all new introductory and summary chapters will be added to contextualize and tie the volume together. Therefore, unlike traditional derivative volumes, we will be able to offer new and updated material to the market and include this largely original content in our ScienceDirect Energy collection. </li><p> </p><li>Due to the inherently multi-disciplinary nature of renewables, many engineers come from backgrounds in Physics, Materials, or Chemical Engineering, and therefore do not have experience working in-depth with electronics. As more and more alternative and distributed energy systems require grid hook-ups and on-site storage, a working knowledge of batteries, inverters and other power electronics components becomes requisite. Further, as renewables enjoy broadening commercial implementation, power electronics professionals are interested to learn of the challenges and strategies particular to applications in alternative energy. This book will bring each group up-to-speed with the primary issues of importance at this technological node.</li><p> </p><li>This content clarifies the juncture of two key coverage areas for our Energy portfolio: alternative sources and power systems. It serves to bridge the information in our power engineering and renewable energy lists, supporting the growing grid cluster in the former and adding key information on practical implementation to the latter. </li></ul><ul><li>Provides a thorough overview of the key technologies, methods and challenges for implementing power electronics in alternative energy systems for optimal power generation</li><li>Includes hard-to-find information on how to apply converters, inverters, batteries, controllers and more for stand-alone and grid-connected systems</li><li>Covers wind and solar applications, as well as ocean and geothermal energy, hybrid systems and fuel cells</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Recent improvements in LED technology have made them as ubiquitous as cell phones. In fact, LEDs light up almost all cell phones screens. The technology's myriad applications and low energy use have made it nearly impossible to get through daily chores without coming in contact with LEDs. Probable advances include increased ability of the technology to support more efficient lighting and enhanced communications. With balanced coverage of the basics and future developments, Introduction to Light Emitting Diode Technology and Applications takes you on a tour of the LED evolution. </p><p>The book begins with a brief history of the effort to enable the device that generates light through modern organic LEDs and reviews the fundamentals and principles of light prior to a detailed explanation of how LEDs generate different colors. After forming this basic foundation, the book examines the key LEDs in lighting and communications. It then discusses the latest opportunities and advancements in high brightness (HB) LED technology, solid state lighting, and handheld electronic applications.</p><p>As we approach a new decade the role of LEDs is literally set to explode, with organic light emitting diodes emerging as a leading next generation technology for electronic displays and lighting. Challenges still exist, including light extraction, luminosity, and white light generation, not to mention non-technical obstacles such as IP disputes and the lack of standards. This book provides a foundation for resolving these issues and developing new applications for LEDs in the promising general illumination market.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span>\nFPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays) can be found in applications such as smart phones, mp3 players, medical imaging devices, and for aerospace and defense technology. FPGAs consist of logic blocks and programmable interconnects. This allows an engineer to start with a blank slate and program the FPGA for a specific task, for instance, digital signal processing, or a specific device, for example, a software-defined radio. Due to the short time to market and ability to reprogram to fix bugs without having to respin FPGAs are in increasingly high demand. <br/><br/>This book is for the engineer that has not yet had any experience with this electrifying and growing field. The complex issue of FPGA design is broken down into four distinct phases - Design / Synthesis / Simulation / Place &amp; Route. Numerous step-by-step examples along with source code accompany the discussion. A brief primer of one of the popular FPGA and hardware languages, VHDL, is incorporated for a simple yet comprehensive learning tool. While a general technology background is assumed, no direct hardware development understanding is needed. Also, included are details on tool-set up, verifaction techniques, and test benches. Reference material consists of a quick reference guide, reserved words, and common VHDL/FPGA terms.<ul><li>Learn how to design and develop FPGAs -- no prior experience necessary!</li><li>Breaks down the complex design and development of FPGAs into easy-to-learn building blocks</li><li>Contains examples, helpful tips, and step-by-step tutorials for synthesis, implementation, simulation, and programming phases</li></ul>\n</span>",

			"description": "<span>\nOver the last decade, advances in the semiconductor fabrication process have led to the realization of true system-on-a-chip devices. But the theories, methods and tools for designing, integrating and verifying these complex systems have not kept pace with our ability to build them. System level design is a critical component in the search for methods to develop designs more productively. However, there are a number of challenges that must be overcome in order to implement system level modeling. <br/> <br/>This book directly addresses that need by developing organizing principles for understanding, assessing, and comparing the different models of computation necessary for system level modeling. Dr. Axel Jantsch identifies the representation of time as the essential feature for distinguishing these models. After developing this conceptual framework, he presents a single formalism for representing very different models, allowing them to be easily compared. As a result, designers, students, and researchers are able to identify the role and the features of the \"right\" model of computation for the task at hand.<br/><br/>*Offers a unique and significant contribution to the emerging field of models of computation <br/><br/>*Presents a systematic way of understanding and applying different Models of Computation to embedded systems and SoC design<br/><br/>*Offers insights and illustrative examples for practioners, researchers and students of complex electronic systems design.\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Multi-core chips from Intel and AMD offer a dramatic boost in speed and responsiveness, and plenty of opportunities for multiprocessing on ordinary desktop computers. But they also present a challenge: More than ever, multithreading is a requirement for good performance. This guide explains how to maximize the benefits of these processors through a portable C++ library that works on Windows, Linux, Macintosh, and Unix systems. With it, you'll learn how to use Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB) effectively for parallel programming -- without having to be a threading expert.<br/><br/>Written by James Reinders, Chief Evangelist of Intel Software Products, and based on the experience of Intel's developers and customers, this book explains the key tasks in multithreading and how to accomplish them with TBB in a portable and robust manner. With plenty of examples and full reference material, the book lays out common patterns of uses, reveals the gotchas in TBB, and gives important guidelines for choosing among alternatives in order to get the best performance.<br/><br/>You'll learn how Intel Threading Building Blocks:</p><ul><li>Enables you to specify tasks instead of threads for better portability, easier programming, more understandable source code, and better performance and scalability in general</li><li>Focuses on the goal of parallelizing computationally intensive work to deliver high-level solutions</li><li>Is compatible with other threading packages, and doesn't force you to pick one package for your entire program</li><li>Emphasizes scalable, data-parallel programming, which allows program performance to increase as you add processors</li><li>Relies on generic programming, which enables you to write the best possible algorithms with the fewest constraints</li></ul>Any C++ programmer who wants to write an application to run on a multi-core system will benefit from this book. TBB is also very approachable for a C programmer or a C++ programmer without much experience with templates. Best of all, you don't need experience with parallel programming or multi-core processors to use this book.<br/><br/></div></span>",

It allows the reader to engage with the immediate development of the power system and to take part in the debate over the future Smart Grid. The book opens with an overview on understanding the Smart Grid, and then is divided into three sections. Section 1 ('Information and Communications Technologies') covers communication standards for the Smart Grid. Section Two discusses sensing, measurement, control and automation.Smart metering and demand side participation are described in detail, before distribution automation and the distribution management system. The last chapter of this section covers advanced transmission system operation. Section Three looks at power electronic and advanced components. First of all the topic of power electronics in power demand and supply is presented. Enabling technologies and advanced components are described last of all, giving a balanced view of Smart Grids.</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>\n    \n      Calculation is the main function of a computer. The central unit is responsible for executing the programs. The microprocessor is its integrated form. This component, since the announcement of its marketing in 1971, has not stopped breaking records in terms of computing power, price reduction and integration of functions (calculation of basic functions, storage with integrated controllers). It is present today in most electronic devices. Knowing its internal mechanisms and programming is essential for the electronics engineer and computer scientist to understand and master the operation of a computer and advanced concepts of programming. This first volume focuses more particularly on the first generations of microprocessors, that is to say those that handle integers in 4 and 8-bit formats. The first chapter presents the calculation function and reminds the memory function. The following is devoted to notions of calculation model and architecture. The concept of bus is then presented. Chapters 4 and 5 can then address the internal organization and operation of the microprocessor first in hardware and then software. The mechanism of the function call, conventional and interrupted, is more particularly detailed in a separate chapter. The book ends with a presentation of architectures of the first microcomputers for a historical perspective.<p> The knowledge is presented in the most exhaustive way possible with examples drawn from current and old technologies that illustrate and make accessible the theoretical concepts. Each chapter ends if necessary with corrected exercises and a bibliography. The list of acronyms used and an index are at the end of the book.</p>\n\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>A step-by-step guide to the design and analysis of CMOS operational amplifiers and comparators</p><p>This volume is a comprehensive text that offers a detailed treatment of the analysis and design principles of two of the most important components of analog metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) circuits, namely operational amplifiers (op-amps) and comparators. The book covers the physical operation of these components, their design procedures, and applications to analog MOS circuits-particularly those involving switched-capacitor circuits, and analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) converters. Roubik Gregorian, a leading authority in the field, gives circuit designers the technical knowledge they need to design high-performance op-amps and comparators suitable for most analog circuit applications. In this self-contained treatment, which is loosely based on his well-received 1986 book, Analog MOS Integrated Circuits for Signal Processing (coauthored with Gabor C. Temes), Gregorian reviews the required basics before advancing to state-of-the-art topics and problem-solving techniques. This valuable guide:</p><ul><li><p>Clearly explains configuration and performance limitation issues affecting the operation of CMOS op-amps and comparators</p></li><li><p>Details advanced design procedures to improve performance</p></li><li><p>Provides practical design examples suitable for a broad range of analog circuit applications</p></li><li><p>Incorporates hundreds of illustrations into the text</p></li><li><p>Concludes each chapter with problems and references to advanced topics, useful in textbook adoptions</p></li></ul><p>Introduction to CMOS Op-Amps and Comparators is invaluable for analog and mixed-signal designers, for senior and graduate students in electrical engineering, and for anyone who would like to keep up with this essential technology.</p></span></span>",

It holds the hands of engineers making the difficult leap from developing in C to the higher-level and more robust Unified Modeling Language, thereby supporting professional development for engineers looking to broaden their skill-sets in order to become more saleable in the job market. <br/><br/>It provides a laboratory environment through a series of progressively more complex exercises that act as building blocks, illustrating the various aspects of  UML and its application to real-time and embedded systems. With its focus on gaining proficiency, it goes a significant step beyond basic UML overviews, providing both comprehensive methodology and the best level of supporting exercises available on the market. Each exercise has a matching solution which is thoroughly explained step-by-step in the back of the book. The techniques used to solve these problems come from the author’s decades of experience designing and constructing real-time systems. After the exercises have been successfully completed, the book will act as a desk reference for engineers, reminding them of how many of the problems they face in their designs can be solved.<ul><li>Tutorial style text with keen focus on in-depth presentation and solution of real-world example problems</li><li>Highly popular, respected and experienced author</li></ul>\n</span>",

Today, it is present in almost all electronic devices. Sound knowledge of its internal mechanisms and programming is essential for electronics and computer engineers to understand and master computer operations and advanced programming concepts. <p>This book in five volumes focuses more particularly on the first two generations of microprocessors, those that handle 4- and 8- bit integers.

			"title": "Software Development for Embedded Multi-core Systems",
			"description": "<span>\nThe multicore revolution has reached the deployment stage in embedded systems ranging from small ultramobile devices to large telecommunication servers.  The transition from single to multicore processors, motivated by the need to increase performance while conserving power, has placed great responsibility on the shoulders of software engineers.  In this new embedded multicore era, the toughest task is the development of code to support more sophisticated systems. This book provides embedded engineers with solid grounding in the skills required to develop software targeting multicore processors.  Within the text, the author undertakes an in-depth exploration of performance analysis, and a close-up look at the tools of the trade. Both general multicore design principles and processor-specific optimization techniques are revealed.

			"description": "<span><p><b>Become confident in your choices. </b></p><div>Where should I live? Is it time to get a new job? Which job candidate should I hire? What business strategy should I pursue?<br/><br/>We spend the majority of our lives making decisions, both big and small. Yet, even though our success is largely determined by the choices that we make, very few of us are equipped with useful decision-making skills. Because of this, we often approach our choices tentatively, or even fearfully, and avoid giving them the time and thought required to put our best foot forward.<br/><br/>In <i>Smart Choices</i>, John Hammond, Ralph Keeney, and Howard Raiffaexperts with over 100 years of experience resolving complex decision problemsoffer a proven, straightforward, and flexible roadmap for making better and more impactful decisions, and offer the tools to achieve your goals in every aspect of your life.<br/><br/>Their step-by-step, divide-and conquer approach will teach you how to:<br/> Evaluate your plans<br/> Break your potential decision into its key elements<br/> Identify the key drivers that are most relevant to your goals<br/> Apply systematic thinking<br/> Use the right information to make the smartest choice<br/><br/><i>Smart Choices</i> doesn’t tell you <i>what</i> to decide; it tells you how. As you routinely use the process, you’ll become more confident in your ability to make decisions at work and at home. And, more importantly, by applying its time-tested methods, you’ll make better decisions going forward.<br/><br/>Be proactive. Don’t wait until a decision is forced on youor made for you. Seek out decisions that advance your long-term goals, values, and beliefs. Take charge of your life by making <i>Smart Choices</i> a lifetime habit.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>An in-depth description of the state-of-the-art of 3D shape analysis techniques and their applications</b></p><p>This book discusses the different topics that come under the title of \"3D shape analysis\". It covers the theoretical foundations and the major solutions that have been presented in the literature. It also establishes links between solutions proposed by different communities that studied 3D shape, such as mathematics and statistics, medical imaging, computer vision, and computer graphics.</p><p>The first part of <i>3D Shape Analysis: Fundamentals, Theory, and Applications </i>provides a review of the background concepts such as methods for the acquisition and representation of 3D geometries, and the fundamentals of geometry and topology. It specifically covers stereo matching, structured light, and intrinsic vs. extrinsic properties of shape. Parts 2 and 3 present a range of mathematical and algorithmic tools (which are used for e.g., global descriptors, keypoint detectors, local feature descriptors, and algorithms) that are commonly used for the detection, registration, recognition, classification, and retrieval of 3D objects. Both also place strong emphasis on recent techniques motivated by the spread of commodity devices for 3D acquisition. Part 4 demonstrates the use of these techniques in a selection of 3D shape analysis applications. It covers 3D face recognition, object recognition in 3D scenes, and 3D shape retrieval. It also discusses examples of semantic applications and cross domain 3D retrieval, i.e. how to retrieve 3D models using various types of modalities, e.g. sketches and/or images. The book concludes with a summary of the main ideas and discussions of the future trends.</p><p><i>3D Shape Analysis: Fundamentals, Theory, and Applications </i>is an excellent reference for graduate students, researchers, and professionals in different fields of mathematics, computer science, and engineering. It is also ideal for courses in computer vision and computer graphics, as well as for those seeking 3D industrial/commercial solutions.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><i>The Circuit Designers Companion, Third Edition</i>, provides the essential information that every circuit designer needs to produce a working circuit, as well as information on how to make a design that is robust, tolerant to noise and temperature, and able to operate in the system for which it is intended. It looks at best practices, design guidelines, and engineering knowledge gained from years of experience, and includes practical, real-world considerations for components and printed circuit boards (PCBs) as well as their manufacturability, reliability, and cost. Organized into nine chapters, the book begins with a discussion of grounding and wiring of electronic or electrical circuits, when to consider grounding, and the main factors that must be taken into account when designing a new PCB. It then introduces the reader to passive components such as resistors and capacitors, potentiometers and inductors, and crystals and resonators, as well as active components like diodes, thyristors and triacs, bipolar transistors, junction field-effect transistors, metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs). It also describes high-speed digital circuit design and analog integrated circuits, including operational amplifiers and comparators, and power supplies such as batteries. The final two chapters focus on electromagnetic compatibility and the latest advances in electronics, along with safety considerations in the design of electronic equipment. This book is an invaluable resource for circuit designers and practicing electronics engineers, electronic engineering students, and professors.<ul><li>An invaluable companion for circuit designers and practicing electronics engineers – gives best practices, design guidelines and engineering knowledge gleaned from years of experience</li><li>Includes practical, real-world considerations for components, PCBs, manufacturability, reliability and cost, enabling engineers to design and troubleshoot faster, cheaper and more effectively</li><li>Contains new material on design tools and communication devices, high-speed digital circuit design, simulation methods and testing</li></ul></span>",

			"title": "Hall-Effect Sensors, 2nd Edition",
			"description": "<span>\nWithout sensors most electronic applications would not exist—sensors perform a vital function, namely providing an interface to the real world. Hall effect sensors, based on a magnetic phenomena, are one of the most commonly used sensing technologies today. In the 1970s it became possible to build Hall effect sensors on integrated circuits with onboard signal processing circuitry, vastly reducing the cost and enabling widespread practical use. One of the first major applications was in computer keyboards, replacing mechanical contacts. Hundreds of millions of these devices are now manufactured each year for use in a great variety of applications, including automobiles, computers, industrial control systems, cell phones, and many others. <br/><br/>The importance of these sensors, however, contrasts with the limited information available. Many recent advances in miniaturization, smart sensor configurations, and networkable sensor technology have led to design changes and a need for reliable information. Most of the technical information on Hall effect sensors is supplied by sensor manufacturers and is slanted toward a particular product line. System design and control engineers need an independent, readable source of practical design information and technical details that is not product- or manufacturer-specific and that shows how Hall effect sensors work, how to interface to them, and how to apply them in a variety of uses. This book covers:<br/>•\tthe physics behind Hall effect sensors<br/>•\tHall effect transducers<br/>•\ttransducer interfacing<br/>•\tintegrated Hall effect sensors and how to interface to them<br/>•\tsensing techniques using Hall effect sensors<br/>•\tapplication-specific sensor ICs<br/>•\trelevant development and design tools<br/><br/>This second edition is expanded and updated to reflect the latest advances in Hall effect devices and applications! <br/><br/>Information about various sensor technologies is scarce, scattered and hard to locate. Most of it is either too theoretical for working engineers, or is manufacturer literature that can’t be entirely trusted. Engineers and engineering managers need a comprehensive, up-to-date, and accurate reference to use when scoping out their designs incorporating Hall effect sensors.<br/><br/>* A comprehensive, up-to-date reference to use when crafting all kinds of designs with Hall effect sensors<br/><br/>*Replaces other information about sensors that is too theoretical, too biased toward one particular manufacturer, or too difficult to locate<br/><br/>*Highly respected and influential author in the burgeoning sensors community\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><p>So much of what is commonplace today was once considered impossible, or at least wishful thinking. Laser beams in the operating room, cars with built-in guidance systems, cell phones with email access.  There's just no getting around the fact that technology always has, and always will be, very cool.But technology isn't only cool; it's also very smart. That's why one of the hottest technological trends nowadays is the creation of  smart homes.At an increasing rate, people are turning their homes into state-of-the-art machines, complete with more switches, sensors, and actuators than you can shake a stick at.  Whether you want to equip your home with motion detectors for added security, install computer-controlled lights for optimum convenience, or even mount an in-home web cam or two purely for entertainment, the world is now your oyster.  Ah, but like anything highly technical, creating a smart home is typically easier said than done.Thankfully, <i>Smart Home Hacks</i> takes the guesswork out of the process.  Through a seemingly unending array of valuable tips, tools, and techniques, <i>Smart Home Hacks</i> explains in clear detail how to use Mac, Windows, or Linux to achieve the automated home of your dreams.  In no time, you'll learn how to turn a loose collection of sensors and switches into a well-automated and well-functioning home no matter what your technical level may be.<i>Smart Home Hacks</i> covers a litany of stand-alone and integrated smart home solutions designed to enhance safety, comfort, and convenience in new and existing homes.  Kitchens, bedrooms, home offices, living rooms, and even bathrooms are all candidates for smart automation and therefore are all addressed in <i>Smart Home Hacks</i>.Intelligently written by engineering guru and George Jetson wannabe, Gordon Meyer, <i>Smart Home Hacks</i> leaves no stone unturned.

However, recent advances are improving these issues.</p><p>This book provides the opportunity to expand your knowledge of innovative supercapacitor applications, comparing them to other commonly used energy storage devices. It will strengthen your understanding of energy storage from a practical, applications-based point-of-view, without requiring detailed examination of underlying electrochemical equations.

			"description": "<span>\nField Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are devices that provide a fast, low-cost way for embedded system designers to customize products and deliver new versions with upgraded features, because they can handle very complicated functions, and be reconfigured an infinite number of times. In addition to introducing the various architectural features available in the latest generation of FPGAs, <i>The Design Warrior’s Guide to FPGAs</i> also covers different design tools and flows.<br/><br/>This book covers information ranging from schematic-driven entry, through traditional HDL/RTL-based simulation and logic synthesis, all the way up to the current state-of-the-art in pure C/C++ design capture and synthesis technology. Also discussed are specialist areas such as mixed hardward/software and DSP-based design flows, along with innovative new devices such as field programmable node arrays (FPNAs). <br/><br/>Clive \"Max\" Maxfield is a bestselling author and engineer with a large following in the electronic design automation (EDA)and embedded systems industry. In this comprehensive book, he covers all the issues of interest to designers working with, or contemplating a move to, FPGAs in their product designs. While other books cover fragments of FPGA technology or applications this is the first to focus exclusively and comprehensively on FPGA use for embedded systems.<ul><li>First book to focus exclusively and comprehensively on FPGA use in embedded designs</li><li>World-renowned best-selling author</li><li>Will help engineers get familiar and succeed with this new technology by providing much-needed advice on choosing the right FPGA for any design project</li></ul>\n</span>",

Fabricated describes our emerging world of printable products, where people design and 3D print their own creations as easily as they edit an online document.</p><p>A 3D printer transforms digital information into a physical object by carrying out instructions from an electronic design file, or 'blueprint.' Guided by a design file, a 3D printer lays down layer after layer of a raw material to 'print' out an object. That's not the whole story, however. The magic happens when you plug a 3D printer into today's mind-boggling digital technologies. Add to that the Internet, tiny, low cost electronic circuitry, radical advances in materials science and biotech and voila! The result is an explosion of technological and social innovation.</p><p><em>Fabricated</em> takes the reader onto a rich and fulfilling journey that explores how 3D printing is poised to impact nearly every part of our lives.</p><p>Aimed at people who enjoy books on business strategy, popular science and novel technology, <em>Fabricated</em> will provide readers with practical and imaginative insights to the question 'how will this technology change my life?' Based on hundreds of hours of research and dozens of interviews with experts from a broad range of industries, Fabricated offers readers an informative, engaging and fast-paced introduction to 3D printing now and in the future.</p></span></span></span>",

			"title": "Designing SOCs with Configured Cores",
			"description": "<span>\nMicroprocessor cores used for SOC design are the direct descendents of Intel’s original 4004 microprocessor. Just as packaged microprocessor ICs vary widely in their attributes, so do microprocessors packaged as IP cores. However, SOC designers still compare and select processor cores the way they previously compared and selected packaged microprocessor ICs. The big problem with this selection method is that it assumes that the laws of the microprocessor universe have remained unchanged for decades. This assumption is no longer valid.<br/><br/>Processor cores for SOC designs can be far more plastic than microprocessor ICs for board-level system designs. Shaping these cores for specific applications produces much better processor efficiency and much lower system clock rates. Together, Tensilica’s Xtensa and Diamond processor cores constitute a family of software-compatible microprocessors covering an extremely wide performance range from simple control processors, to DSPs, to 3-way superscalar processors. Yet all of these processors use the same software-development tools so that programmers familiar with one processor in the family can easily switch to another.<br/><br/>This book emphasizes a processor-centric MPSOC (multiple-processor SOC) design style shaped by the realities of the 21st-century and nanometer silicon. It advocates the assignment of tasks to firmware-controlled processors whenever possible to maximize SOC flexibility, cut power dissipation, reduce the size and number of hand-built logic blocks, shrink the associated verification effort, and minimize the overall design risk.<br/><br/>· An essential, no-nonsense guide to the design of 21st-century mega-gate SOCs using nanometer silicon.<br/>· Discusses today's key issues affecting SOC design, based on author's decades of personal experience in developing large digital systems as a design engineer while working at Hewlett-Packard's Desktop Computer Division and at EDA workstation pioneer Cadnetix, and covering such topics as an award-winning technology journalist and editor-in-chief for EDN magazine and the Microprocessor Report.<br/>· Explores conventionally accepted boundaries and perceived limits of processor-based system design and then explodes these artificial constraints through a fresh outlook on and discussion of the special abilities of processor cores designed specifically for SOC design.<br/>· Thorough exploration of the evolution of processors and processor cores used for ASIC and SOC design with a look at where the industry has come from, and where it's going.<br/>· Easy-to-understand explanations of the capabilities of configurable and extensible processor cores through a detailed examination of Tensilica's configurable, extensible Xtensa processor core and six pre-configured Diamond cores.<br/>· The most comprehensive assessment available of the practical aspects of configuring and using multiple processor cores to achieve very difficult and ambitious SOC price, performance, and power design goals.\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><p><em>Sport, Masculinities and Sexualities</em> examines the impact of decreasing cultural homophobia on both gay and straight male athletes. It suggests that the study of sport, masculinities and sexualities emerged during a time of extreme homophobia— the 1980. Cultural homophobia declined, however, throughout the 1990s and the first decade of the new millennia. Consequently, this research argues that the way young men view homosexuality and masculinity has also changed, resulting not only in improved conditions for sexual minorities in sport, but it has also promoted a culture of softer, more tactile and emotional forms of heterosexual masculinities. The ten studies presented in this book reflect this shift in masculinities; highlighting the necessity of developing new ways of theorizing the changing dynamics between masculinities, sexualities and physical cultures in the next decade.</p><p>This book is based on the original special issue published in the <em>Journal of Homosexuality</em>.</p></span>",

			"title": "Microprocessor Architectures, 2nd Edition",
			"description": "<span>\n'Why are there all these different processor architectures and what do they all mean? Which processor will I use? How should I choose it?'  Given the task of selecting an architecture or design approach, both engineers and managers require a knowledge of the whole system and an explanation of the design tradeoffs and their effects. This is information that rarely appears in data sheets or user manuals. This book fills that knowledge gap.<br/><br/> Section 1 provides a primer and history of the three basic microprocessor architectures. Section 2 describes the ways in which the architectures react with the system. Section 3 looks at some more commercial aspects such as semiconductor technology, the design cycle, and selection criteria. The appendices provide benchmarking data and binary compatibility standards.  Since the first edition of this book was published, much has happened within the industry. The Power PC architecture has appeared and RISC has become a more significant challenger to CISC. The book now includes new material on Power PC, and a complete chapter devoted to understanding the RISC challenge. The examples used in the text have been based on Motorola microprocessor families, but the system considerations are also applicable to other processors. For this reason comparisons to other designs have been included, and an overview of other processors including the Intel 80x86 and Pentium, DEC Alpha, SUN Sparc, and MIPS range has been given.  Steve Heath has been involved in the design and development of microprocessor based systems since 1982. These designs have included VMEbus systems, microcontrollers, IBM PCs, Apple Macintoshes, and both CISC and RISC based multiprocessor systems, while using operating systems as varied as MS-DOS, UNIX, Macintosh OS and real time kernels. An avid user of computer systems, he has written numerous articles and papers for the electronics press, as well as books from Butterworth-Heinemann including VMEbus: A Practical Companion; PowerPC: A Practical Companion; MAC User's Pocket Book; UNIX Pocket Book; Upgrading Your PC Pocket Book; Upgrading Your MAC Pocket Book; and Effective PC Networking.<br/>\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p><b>A Unified Summary of the Models and Optimization Methods Used in Computational Lithography</b></p><p>Optical lithography is one of the most challenging areas of current integrated circuit manufacturing technology. The semiconductor industry is relying more on resolution enhancement techniques (RETs), since their implementation does not require significant changes in fabrication infrastructure. <em>Computational Lithography</em> is the first book to address the computational optimization of RETs in optical lithography, providing an in-depth discussion of optimal optical proximity correction (OPC), phase shifting mask (PSM), and off-axis illumination (OAI) RET tools that use model-based mathematical optimization approaches.</p><p>The book starts with an introduction to optical lithography systems, electric magnetic field principles, and the fundamentals of optimization from a mathematical point of view. It goes on to describe in detail different types of optimization algorithms to implement RETs. Most of the algorithms developed are based on the application of the OPC, PSM, and OAI approaches and their combinations. Algorithms for coherent illumination as well as partially coherent illumination systems are described, and numerous simulations are offered to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms. In addition, mathematical derivations of all optimization frameworks are presented.</p><p>The accompanying MATLAB® software files for all the RET methods described in the book make it easy for readers to run and investigate the codes in order to understand and apply the optimization algorithms, as well as to design a set of optimal lithography masks. The codes may also be used by readers for their research and development activities in their academic or industrial organizations. An accompanying MATLAB® software guide is also included. An accompanying MATLAB® software guide is included, and readers can download the software to use with the guide at <code>ftp://ftp.wiley.com/public/sci_tech_med/computational_lithography</code>.</p><p>Tailored for both entry-level and experienced readers, <em>Computational Lithography</em> is meant for faculty, graduate students, and researchers, as well as scientists and engineers in industrial organizations whose research or career field is semiconductor IC fabrication, optical lithography, and RETs. Computational lithography draws from the rich theory of inverse problems, optics, optimization, and computational imaging; as such, the book is also directed to researchers and practitioners in these fields.</p></span></span></span>",

That’s why the field requires a reference that takes the focus off of numbers and concentrates more on larger economic concepts than on technical details. </p><p><strong>Semiconductors: Integrated Circuit Design for Manufacturability</strong> covers the gradual evolution of integrated circuit design (ICD) as a basis to propose strategies for improving return-on-investment (ROI) for ICD in manufacturing. Where most books put the spotlight on detailed engineering enhancements and their implications for device functionality, in contrast, this one offers, among other things, crucial, valuable historical background and roadmapping, all illustrated with examples. </p><p><br/><strong>Presents actual test cases that <em>illustrate</em> product challenges, <em>examine</em> possible solution strategies, and <em>demonstrate</em> how to select and implement the right one</strong></p><p><br/>This book shows that DfM is a powerful generic engineering concept with potential extending beyond its usual application in automated layout enhancements centered on proximity correction and pattern density. This material explores the concept of ICD for production by breaking down its major steps: product definition, design, layout, and manufacturing. Averting extended discussion of technology, techniques, or specific device dimensions, the author also avoids the clumsy chapter architecture that can hinder other books on this subject. The result is an extremely functional, systematic presentation that simplifies existing approaches to DfM, outlining a clear set of criteria to help readers assess reliability, functionality, and yield. With careful consideration of the economic and technical trade-offs involved in ICD for manufacturing, this reference addresses techniques for physical, electrical, and logical design, keeping coverage fresh and concise for the designers, manufacturers, and researchers defining product architecture and research programs.</p></span>",

These “flying tripods” have given photographers the ability to place their cameras virtually anywhere they want, creating still images and video footage that were previously impossible to capture. Many photographers have a drone or quadcopter right at the top of their “I want” list. And many others have already purchased a drone a bit ahead of the curve. <br/><br/>No matter what model one may own—DJI, 3DR, Yuneec, GoPro—all of these photographers need to learn how to put this new gear to good use in their aerial photography. They need to learn how to safely operate and fly a drone, how to create compelling photos and video, and how to make their work stand out from the crowd in this exciting new field.<br/><br/><em>The Photographer’s Guide to Drones</em> explains everything photographers need to know about drones and quadcopters in order to take their photography to new levels…literally. <br/><br/>Photographer and author Colin Smith guides the reader along, as he teaches: </p><ul>• How to fly a drone, including practice flight patterns and controller tips that will help readers master the basics</ul><ul>• New rules of composition for aerial photography as they apply to drone and quadcopter imagery</ul><ul>• How to create the best files for both still photos and video</ul><ul><ul>• Post-processing techniques unique to aerial photography that readers need to know, such as how to make videos look both dynamic and smooth</ul></ul><p>The book also features award-winning and beautiful aerial photography. Plus, at the beginning of each of the book's eight chapters, beautiful three-page fold-out images inspire readers on their journey to creating images that truly stand above the crowd.</p><p><strong>Take your aerial photography to new heights with <em>The Photographer's Guide to Drones.</em></strong></p></span>",

Lhotka\nshows you how to use analog distortion filters, custom textures,\nand lens modifiers to create images that look\nlike¿<em>you</em>¿made them, not an app. You’ll also\nlearn how to re-create classic printmaking techniques using\nnon-toxic digital alternatives, including a water-based transfer\nsolution that’s safe to use anywhere, whether it’s the\nstudio, classroom, or kitchen counter.</p><p>Anyone can push a button and create a nice print–there is\nlittle challenge in getting a high-quality image out of a desktop\nprinter these days. Lhotka shows you how to take your work to the\nnext level by printing on materials such as wood, glass, plastics,\nand metal. For the truly adventurous, Lhotka shares her custom\ntechniques for taking photographs and applying them to 3D-printed\nobjects created with popular consumer 3D printers.</p><p>Part artist/part mad scientist, Lhotka has spent many hours\nexperimenting, hacking, and tearing things apart to discover new\nways to take, make, and print images. She encourages you to take\nthe techniques you’ll learn in this book, hack them, and make\nthem your own. With some techniques you will fail. It will be\nmessy. You will try and have to try again.

The utilisation of advanced materials and passive technologies in buildings would substantially reduce the energy demand and improve the environmental impact and carbon footprint of building stock worldwide.<br/><br/>Materials for energy efficiency and thermal comfort in buildings critically reviews the advanced building materials applicable for improving the built environment. Part one reviews both fundamental building physics and occupant comfort in buildings, from heat and mass transport, hygrothermal behaviour, and ventilation, on to thermal comfort and health and safety requirements.<br/><br/>Part two details the development of advanced materials and sustainable technologies for application in buildings, beginning with a review of lifecycle assessment and environmental profiling of materials. The section moves on to review thermal insulation materials, materials for heat and moisture control, and heat energy storage and passive cooling technologies. Part two concludes with coverage of modern methods of construction, roofing design and technology, and benchmarking of façades for optimised building thermal performance.<br/><br/>Finally, Part three reviews the application of advanced materials, design and technologies in a range of existing and new building types, including domestic, commercial and high-performance buildings, and buildings in hot and tropical climates.<br/><br/>This book is of particular use to, mechanical, electrical and HVAC engineers, architects and low-energy building practitioners worldwide, as well as to academics and researchers in the fields of building physics, civil and building engineering, and materials science.<br/><br/><ul><li>Explores improving energy efficiency and thermal comfort through material selection and sustainable technologies</li><li>Documents the development of advanced materials and sustainable technologies for applications in building design and construction</li><li>Examines fundamental building physics and occupant comfort in buildings featuring heat and mass transport, hygrothermal behaviour and ventilation</li></ul></span>",

The focus is on embedded systems but it also serves as a general guide to building custom computing systems.</p><p>The text describes the fundamental technology in terms of hardware, software, and a set of principles to guide the development of Platform FPGA systems. The goal is to show how to systematically and creatively apply these principles to the construction of application-specific embedded system architectures. There is a strong focus on using free and open source software to increase productivity. Each chapter is organized into two parts. The white pages describe concepts, principles, and general knowledge. The gray pages provide a technical rendition of the main issues of the chapter and show the concepts applied in practice. This includes step-by-step details for a specific development board and tool chain so that the reader can carry out the same steps on their own.</p><p>Rather than try to demonstrate the concepts on a broad set of tools and boards, the text uses a single set of tools (Xilinx Platform Studio, Linux, and GNU) throughout and uses a single developer board (Xilinx ML-510) for the examples.</p><ul><li>Explains how to use the Platform FPGA to meet complex design requirements and improve product performance</li><li>Presents both fundamental concepts together with pragmatic, step-by-step instructions for building a system on a Platform FPGA</li><li>Includes detailed case studies, extended real-world examples, and lab exercises</li></ul></span>",

But for makers who work with their hands and bibliophiles who still appreciate the physical artifact of the written word, there will always be something special about print. If you're one of these stubborn luddites, you might just want your library of magazines to last. You might even want your digital content to take on new life as an aesthetic object that survives as a dead-tree edition. When you’ve completed this 32-page project (when printed, it's an even two 16-page signatures), you’ll have a durable, attractive hardcover copy of this booklet (or your favorite magazine, in the event that the two are not one and the same) that will last forever and lie flat, allowing future generations to carry on the craft and tradition of preserving bona-fide pieces of printed matter.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><i>Current Sources and Voltage References</i> provides fixed, well-regulated levels of current or voltage within a circuit. These are two of the most important “building blocks “ of analog circuits, and are typically used in creating most analog IC designs. <br/><br/>Part 1 shows the reader how current sources are created, how they can be optimized, and how they can be utilized by the OEM circuit designer. The book serves as a “must-have reference for the successful development of precision circuit applications. It shows practical examples using either BJTs, FETs, precision op amps, or even matched CMOS arrays being used to create highly accurate current source designs, ranging from nanoAmps to Amps. In each chapter the most important characteristics of the particular semiconductor type being studied are carefully reviewed. This not only serves as a helpful refresher for experienced engineers, but also as a good foundation for all EE student coursework, and includes device models and relevant equations.<br/><br/>Part 2 focuses on semiconductor voltage references, from their design to their various practical enhancements. It ranges from the simple Zener diode to today’s most advanced topologies, including Analog Devices’ XFET® and Intersil’s FGA™ (invented while this book was being written). Over 300 applications and circuit diagrams are shown throughout this easy-to-read, practical reference book.<br/><br/>* Discusses how to design low-noise, precision current sources using matched transistor pairs.<br/><br/>* Explains the design of high power current sources with power MOSFETs<br/><br/>* Gives proven techniques to reduce drift and improve accuracy in voltage references.\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>This completely revised edition of <em>Energy Law and the Environment</em> has greatly expanded its scope to explore how international law engages with multinational companies regarding energy sources, ownership of those resources, and state sovereignty. Written for all the players in the energy sector, lawyers and non-lawyers alike, this second edition has been aptly renamed <strong>International Law for Energy and the Environment</strong>. It considers issues of energy sector regulation related to economics and protection of intellectual property associated with development of technologies for mitigating environmentally damaging emissions.<br/><br/>The book is divided into three sections that build upon each other. Section I addresses the interrelationship between international law, environmental law, and the energy sector. It covers regulatory theory within an economic context; the regulation of multinational companies with regard to international regulation and state rules; and trade, competition, and environmental law in the energy sector. Section II examines the regulation of the various energy sectors—oil, gas, and nuclear—and how international law affects them and their ownership, risk, and liability.<br/><br/>Section III considers some of the main energy producer/user jurisdictions where energy companies operate, including more developed systems around the world, such as the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Norway, and Australia as well as two major emerging economies, namely, India and China. The final chapter reviews the material presented in the book, drawing conclusions about the current state of environmental regulation in the energy sector and identifying potential future developments.<br/></p></span></span>",

Today, it is present in almost all electronic devices. Sound knowledge of its internal mechanisms and programming is essential for electronics and computer engineers to understand and master computer operations and advanced programming concepts. This book in five volumes focuses more particularly on the first two generations of microprocessors, those that handle 4- and 8- bit integers. Microprocessor 4 – the fourth of five volumes – addresses the software aspects of this component. Coding of an instruction, addressing modes and the main features of the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of a generic component are presented. Futhermore, two approaches are discussed for altering the flow of execution using mechanisms of subprogram and interrupt. A comprehensive approach is used, with examples drawn from current and past technologies that illustrate theoretical concepts, making them accessible.<br/>   </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The Smart Grid has the potential to revolutionize electricity delivery systems, and the security of its infrastructure is a vital concern not only for cyber-security practitioners, engineers, policy makers, and utility executives, but also for the media and consumers. <strong>Smart Grid Security: An End-to-End View of Security in the New Electrical Grid</strong> explores the important techniques, challenges, and forces that will shape how we achieve a secure twenty-first century electric grid.<br/><br/><strong>Includes a Foreword by Michael Assante, President and CEO, National Board of Information Security Examiners<br/><br/></strong>Following an overview of the components of the Smart Grid, the book delves into the evolution of security standards and regulations and examines ways in which the Smart Grid might be regulated. The authors discuss the technical details about how metering technology is being implemented and the likely threats and vulnerabilities that utilities will face. They address the home area network (HAN) and examine distribution and transmission—the foundation for the delivery of electricity, along with distributed generation, micro-grids, and operations.<br/><br/>The book explores future concepts—such as energy storage and the use of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs)—in addition to the concomitant risk for fraud and manipulation with stored energy. Consumer-related issues are discussed as they pertain to emerging ways of receiving and generating energy. The book examines dysfunctions ranging from inadvertent outages to cyber-attack and presents recommendations on how to respond to these incidents. It concludes with speculation of future cyber-security challenges and discusses new ways that the grid can be defended, such as better key management and protection.<br/><br/>Written in a style rigorous enough for the practitioner yet accessible to a broad audience, this comprehensive volume covers a topic that is becoming more critical to industry and consumers everywhere.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>IBM communication controllers have reliably carried the bulk of\nthe world's business traffic for more than 30 years. Over the\nyears, IBM controllers have been enhanced to the point that the\nfunctional capabilities of the current products, the 3745\nCommunication Controller and the 3746 Nways Multiprotocol\nController , surpass the capabilities of any other data networking\nequipment ever developed. Beyond the SNA architecture PU Type 4,\nbeyond APPN, even beyond IP routing, these controllers support an\nextraordinary set of functions and protocols. Because of their long\nhistory and their functional richness, IBM controllers continue to\nplay a critical role in the networks of most of the largest\ncompanies in the world.</p><p>Over the past decade, however, focus has shifted from SNA\nnetworks and applications to TCP/IP and Internet technologies. In\nsome cases, SNA application traffic now runs over IP-based networks\nusing technologies such as TN3270 and Data Link Switching (DLSw).\nIn other cases, applications have been changed, or business\nprocesses reengineered, using TCP/IP rather than SNA. Consequently,\nfor some organizations, the network traffic that traverses IBM\ncommunication controllers has declined to the point where it is in\nthe organization’s best interest to find functional\nalternatives for the remaining uses of their controllers so they\ncan consolidate and possibly eliminate controllers from their\nenvironments.</p><p>This IBM Redbooks publication provides you with a starting point\nto help in your efforts to optimize your communication controller\nenvironment, whether simply consolidating them or migrating from\nthem altogether. We discuss alternative means to provide the\ncommunication controller functions that you use or ways to\neliminate the need for those functions outright. Where multiple\noptions exist, we discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages\nof each.</p></span>",

			"title": "Embedded Multitasking",
			"description": "<span>\nIn an embedded system, firmware is the software that directly interfaces with the microcontroller, controlling the system’s function. The major forces driving the embedded firmware development process today are reduced development times, increased complexity, and the need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. These forces translate into strenuous design requirements for embedded engineers and programmers. Many low-level embedded microcontroller designs have insufficient memory and/or architectural limitations that make the use of a real-time operating system impractical. The techniques presented in this book allow the design of robust multitasking firmware through the use of interleaved state machines. This book presents a complete overview of multitasking terminology and basic concepts. Practical criteria for task selection and state machine design are also discussed.<br/>Designing multitasking firmware is arduous, complex and fraught with potential for errors, and there is no one, “standard way to do it. This book will present a complete and well-organized design approach with examples and sample source code that designers can follow.<ul><li>Covers every aspect of design from the system level to the component level, including system timing, communicating with the hardware, integration and testing.</li></ul>\n</span>",

			"title": "Practical Embedded Security",
			"description": "<span>\nThe great strides made over the past decade in the complexity and network functionality of embedded systems have significantly enhanced their attractiveness for use in critical applications such as medical devices and military communications. However, this expansion into critical areas has presented embedded engineers with a serious new problem: their designs are now being targeted by the same malicious attackers whose predations have plagued traditional systems for years.  Rising concerns about data security in embedded devices are leading engineers to pay more attention to security assurance in their designs than ever before. This is particularly challenging due to embedded devices’ inherent resource constraints such as limited power and memory. Therefore, traditional security solutions must be customized to fit their profile, and entirely new security concepts must be explored. However, there are few resources available to help engineers understand how to implement security measures within the unique embedded context. This new book from embedded security expert Timothy Stapko is the first to provide engineers with a comprehensive guide to this pivotal topic. From a brief review of basic security concepts, through clear explanations of complex issues such as choosing the best cryptographic algorithms for embedded utilization, the reader is provided with all the information needed to successfully produce safe, secure embedded devices.<ul><li>The ONLY book dedicated to a comprehensive coverage of embedded security!</li><li>Covers both hardware- and software-based embedded security solutions for preventing and dealing with attacks</li><li>Application case studies support practical explanations of all key topics, including network protocols, wireless and cellular communications, languages (Java and C/++), compilers, web-based interfaces, cryptography, and an entire section on SSL</li></ul>\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>What do you get when you combine an electronics hobbyist, hacker, garage mechanic, kitchen table inventor, tinkerer, and entrepreneur? A \"maker,\" of course. Playful and creative, makers are—through expertise and experimentation—creating art, products, and processes that change the way we think and interact with the world.</p><p>As you'll see from the 21 interviews in <em>Makers at Work</em>, inquisitive makers are just as apt to pick up a laser cutter or an Arduino as a wrench to fashion something new. For example, you'll meet Jeri Ellsworth, who might provide a video lecture on magnetic logic one day and a tutorial on welding a roll bar on a stock car the next. You'll also meet Eben Upton, who put cheap, powerful computing in the hands of everyone with the Raspberry Pi; Becky Stern, who jazzes up clothing with sensors and LEDs; and bunnie Huang, who knows the ins and outs of the Shenzhen, China, electronics parts markets as well as anyone. As all the interviews in <em>Makers at Work</em> show, makers have something in common: reverence for our technical past coupled with an aversion to convention. If they can't invent new processes or products, it's simply not worth doing.</p><p>Crazy as foxes, makers—working in the spirit of Tesla, Wozniak, Edison, Gates, Musk and many others—can bring sophisticated products to the people or to the market as fast or faster than large corporations. And they are not just enabling new technologies and devices—they are changing the way these devices are funded, manufactured, assembled, and delivered.</p><p><em>Makers at Work</em> puts a spotlight on the maker mindset and motivation of those who are reinventing the world one object or idea at a time. You will:</p><li><p>Meet the individuals who define what it means to be a maker.</p></li><li><p>Learn about the tools and technologies driving the new industrial revolution.</p></li><li><p>Discover ways to scale your weekend project into a profitable business.</p></li><li><p>See how others have used to crowdfunding to make their visions a reality.</p></li><li><p>Learn how open-source hardware and software is enabling whole new categories of products by removing barriers of entry for inventors.</p></li><p>The new masters of the \"Makerverse\" ask two questions: Can it be done? Is it fun? As these interviews will show, the answer to both questions is, \"Let's find out.\"</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><p>You will:</p><li><p>Learn about 3d printing and how it is changing manufacturing.</p></li><li><p>Discover new software tools for designing things on your own.</p></li><li><p>Learn how to source parts, code, or ideas for your creations.</p></li><li><p>Meet maker pioneers who helped open up a new world, and makers who have used crowdfunding to support their efforts.</p></li><li><p>Uncover recipes for success or failure when bringing physical products to market.</p></li><li><p>Learn ways to scale your weekend project into a profitable business from experienced entrepreneurs.</p></li><li><p>Learn how open-source hardware and software is enabling new classes of products by removing the barrier of entry for inventors.</p></li><li><p>Open your mind to new ideas, methods, things, and possibilities.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>This book is for anyone with an independent spirit, creative bent, or natural curiosity who believes you can create whatever your mind can conceive and wants to see how others have done just that.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><strong><em>Open a Window into the Autonomic Nervous System</em></strong></p><p>Quantifying the amount of autonomic nervous system activity in an individual patient can be extremely important, because it provides a gauge of disease severity in a large number of diseases. Heart rate variability (HRV) calculated from both short-term and longer-term electrocardiograms is an ideal window into such autonomic activity for two reasons: one, heart rate is sensitive to autonomic activity in the entire body, and two, recording electrocardiograms is inexpensive and non-invasive unlike other techniques currently available for autonomic assessment, such as microneurography and metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning. <strong>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Signal Analysis: Clinical Applications</strong> provides a comprehensive review of three major aspects of HRV: mechanism, technique, and clinical applications. </p><p><strong><em>Learn Techniques for HRV Signal Analysis</em></strong></p><p>Edited by an engineer, a cardiologist, and a neurologist, and featuring contributions by widely published international researchers, this interdisciplinary book begins by reviewing the many signal processing techniques developed to extract autonomic activity information embedded in heart-rate records. The classical time and frequency domain measures, baroreceptor sensitivity, and newer non-linear measures of HRV are described with a fair amount of mathematical detail with the biomedical engineer and mathematically oriented physician in mind. The book also covers two recent HRV methods, heart-rate turbulence and phase-rectified signal averaging. </p><p><strong><em>Use of HRV in Clinical Care</em></strong></p><p>The large clinical section is a must-read for clinicians and engineers wishing to get an insight into how HRV is applied in medicine. Nineteen chapters altogether are devoted to uses of HRV in: </p><ul><li>Monitoring—for example to predict potential complications in pregnancies, fetal distress, and in neonatal critical care</li><li>Acute care—for gauging the depth of anesthesia during surgery and predicting change in patient status in the intensive care unit</li><li>Chronic disorders—for assessing the severity of congestive heart failure, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and depression</li></ul><p>Bringing together the latest research, this comprehensive reference demonstrates the utility and potential of HRV signal analysis in both the clinic and physiology laboratory. </p></span>",

Distinct from IQ, this type of expertise consists of practical wisdom: accumulated knowledge, know-how, and intuition gained through extensive experience. How do such smarts develop? And what happens when people with deep smarts leave a particular job or the organization? Can any of their smarts be transferred? Should they be? Basing their conclusions on a multi-year research project, Dorothy Leonard and Walter Swap argue that cultivating and managing deep smarts are critical parts of any leader's job. The authors draw on examples from firms of all sizes and types to illustrate the connection between deep smarts and organizational viability and continuous innovation. Leonard and Swap describe the origins and limits of deep smarts and outline processes for cultivating and leveraging them across the organization. Developing an experience repertoire and receiving strategic guidance from wise coaches can help individuals move up the ladder of expertise from novice to master. Addressing a topic of increasing importance as the Boomer generation retires, Deep Smarts challenges leaders to take a hands-on approach to managing the experience-based knowledge shaping the future of their organizations.</div></span>",

At its core, the magnitude of your success is based on the quality of your decisions. The problem is that human beings are poor decision-makers; we tend to approach problems <i>after</i> they arise instead of planning for them in advance. We put too much weight on instinct, belief, and \"gut feeling.\" We make the same mistakes over and over again—so reliably, in fact, that cognitive science can accurately predict exactly which mistakes we'll make and when. This book offers a way to understand and plan for the human mind's usual tendencies to help you make smarter investment decisions. Using a framework based on cognitive research, you'll learn how to approach decisions objectively, systematically, and constantly review your process; you'll take action based on evidence instead of intuition, and get ahead of potential problems before they get the best of you.</p><p>With so much riding on the correctness of your choices, natural tendency can be a dangerous thing. This book shows you how to remove the bias and emotion to start making choices backed by hard evidence and objective data and lower your stress.</p><ul><li>Shift your processes from reactive to proactive</li><li>Base decisions on reality over belief</li><li>Eliminate cognitive bias and reduce common mistakes</li><li>Make better decisions with a systematic, objective approach</li></ul><p>Why do we begin managing risk only once it becomes apparent? Why do we <i>react </i>to the market instead of making the big decisions <i>before</i> emotion takes over? Investing has always been a largely reactive field, but those who dominate it approach decision-making less like a human and more like a machine. <i>AlphaBrain</i> shows you how to get <i>real</i> about investing, with cognitive techniques that lead to smarter, evidence-based decisions.</p></span>",

It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Presented in three parts, <em>Embedded Systems: Hardware, Design, and Implementation</em> provides readers with an immersive introduction to this rapidly growing segment of the computer industry.</p><p>Acknowledging the fact that embedded systems control many of today's most common devices such as smart phones, PC tablets, as well as hardware embedded in cars, TVs, and even refrigerators and heating systems, the book starts with a basic introduction to embedded computing systems. It hones in on system-on-a-chip (SoC), multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC), and network-on-chip (NoC). It then covers on-chip integration of software and custom hardware accelerators, as well as fabric flexibility, custom architectures, and the multiple I/O standards that facilitate PCB integration.</p><p>Next, it focuses on the technologies associated with embedded computing systems, going over the basics of field-programmable gate array (FPGA), digital signal processing (DSP) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technology, architectural support for on-chip integration of custom accelerators with processors, and O/S support for these systems.</p><p>Finally, it offers full details on architecture, testability, and computer-aided design (CAD) support for embedded systems, soft processors, heterogeneous resources, and on-chip storage before concluding with coverage of software support—in particular, O/S Linux.</p><p><em>Embedded Systems: Hardware, Design, and Implementation</em> is an ideal book for design engineers looking to optimize and reduce the size and cost of embedded system products and increase their reliability and performance.</p></span></span></span></span>",

			"title": "Analog Computing",
			"description": "<span><p>This book is a comprehensive introduction to analog computing. As most textbooks about this powerful computing paradigm date back to the 1960s and 1970s, it fills a void and forges a bridge from the early days of analog computing to future applications. The idea of analog computing is not new. In fact, this computing paradigm is nearly forgotten, although it offers a path to both high-speed and low-power computing, which are in even more demand now than they were back in the heyday of electronic analog computers. This first chapters of this book define the notion of analog computing and cover the early history of mechanical and electromechanical analog computers before focusing on the development and the basics of electronic analog computing elements and computers based on these. Two chapters give an introduction to the programming of analog computers with a number of detailed sample problems and solutions. These problems range from simple mass-spring-damper systems to predator-prey simulations and conformal mappings. The following chapters introduce the basic concepts of hybrid computers and digital differential analyzers, the latter of which offer an enourmous potential for future applications based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or the like. The second half of the book is dedicated to an overview of typical applications of analog computers based on a comprehensive bibliography. The last chapter describes future prospects for the analog computing paradigm.</p></span>",

But there will always be a need for traditional workshop skills and tools. Charles Platt's <i>Make: Tools</i> applies the same approach to its subject matter as his bestselling Make: Electronics -- in-depth explanations and hands-on projects that gradually increase in level of challenge.</p><p>Illustrated in full color with hundreds of photographs and line drawings, the book serves as a perfect introduction to workshop tools and materials for young adults and adults alike. Platt focuses on basic hands tools and assumes no prior experience or knowledge on the part of the reader. The projects all result in fun games, toys, and puzzles. The book serves as both a hands-on tutorial a reference that will be returned to again and again.</p></div></span>",

Even off-the-shelf machines that are pre-built must be aligned and periodically realigned throughout their life cycle. <em>Maintaining and Troubleshooting Your 3D Printer </em><em/>helps you achieve and hold proper alignment. <em>Maintaining and Troubleshooting Your 3D Printer </em><em/>also helps with software and hardware troubleshooting. You�ll learn to diagnose and solve firmware calibration problems, filament and feed problems, chassis issues, and more. </p><p>Finally there are regular maintenance and enhancements. You�ve invested significantly in your 3D printer. Protect that investment using the guidance in this book. Learn to clean and lubricate your printer, to maintain the chassis, and know when realignment of the print bed is needed. Learn ways to master your craft and improve the quality of your prints through such things as post-print finishing and filament management. </p><p>Don't let the challenges of 3D printing stand in the way of creativity. <em>Maintaining and Troubleshooting Your 3D Printer</em> by Charles Bell helps you conquer the challenges and get the most benefit from your expensive investment in personal fabrication.</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><i> </i><p>Low-Carbon Energy Security from a European Perspective draws on the European Commission‘s funded project MILESECURE-2050. It considers low-carbon energy security and energy geopolitics in Europe, with a focus on four thematic clusters: challenging the energy security paradigm; climate change and energy security objectives (the components of a secure and low-carbon energy system); energy security in a geopolitical perspective, as it relates to economics, resource competition, and availability; and the influence of large scale renewable energy projects on energy security and shifting geopolitical alliances. </p><p>An overarching narrative is that optimizing the energy system simultaneously across different objectives may be impossible, i.e., lowest cost, least environmental impact, minimal downtime, regional supply. This book explores these charged topics through insights from a series of novel, new energy project case studies, and demonstrates the need for difficult political conversations within Europe and beyond by posing fundamental yet new questions about the energy security paradigm.</p><ul><li>Offers a unique perspective on low-carbon energy security by considering the assumptions behind current energy security needs</li><li>Suggests the benefit of envisioning energy security through out-of-the-box scenario development with respect to the energy system</li><li>Includes energy in an international scenario with case studies from Africa, Russia, Ukraine, Morroco, China, South America, and Europe</li><li>Draws on the European Commission‘s funded project MILESECURE-2050</li></ul></span>",

Without detailing all the aspects related to the design of embedded systems, this book, which was written by specialists in electronics, data processing and telecommunications and networks, gives an interesting point of view of communication techniques and problems in embedded systems. This choice is easily justified by the fact that embedded systems are today massively communicating and that telecommunications and networks constitute the main sector of embedded systems.</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Carbon Transfer Printing is a book about one of the earliest photographic processes that provided the first permanent printing methods, available in one form or another for over 150 years. This book reviews the extensive history of carbon transfer and related pigment processes in both monochrome and color, to serve as point source for a new carbon printer to begin to master the craft of carbon printing, as well as provide new material for experienced carbon printers so they can expand their techniques. The book includes never-before-published information on pre-sensitizing carbon tissue with newly identified compounds, information on the safe use and disposal of hexavalent chromium compounds, and simplified methods of producing 3-color carbon prints. </p><p></p><i>\n</i><p>Carbon Transfer Printing is divided into two parts, illustrated with 175 photographs. Part One is a complete how-to on the carbon transfer process, from simple to complex, with a troubleshooting guide and an extensive chapter on digital negatives. Part Two is devoted to contemporary carbon printers who share their methods and secrets to creating their beautiful carbon prints.</p><p></p><p>Topics that the book covers are:</p><ul><p>\n</p><li>Key events in carbon’s history</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>How to organize the carbon workplace</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Sections on necessary supplies and equipment</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>A step-by-step digital method of making high quality digital negatives </li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Simple and advanced methods of carbon printing</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>How to make carbon tissue, including several methods of pre-sensitizing</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>How to choose UV light sources for printing in carbon</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Step-by-step processing directions</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>How to prepare final support papers</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Troubleshooting carbon</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Multi-layer printing to add tone, or make a full color carbon print</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>Finishing and final presentation of carbon prints</li><p></p><p>\n</p><li>A gallery of images and advice from contemporary carbon printers</li><p></p></ul><p></p><i>\n</i><p>Carbon Transfer Printing is designed for both the beginning carbon enthusiast as well as for the advanced practitioner. Backed with extensive research on carbon printing from books, journals, and magazine articles from the 1800s to present day, and the extensive personal experience in carbon printing of the authors, there is enough information in this book to provide inspiration and proof of both the glorious past of carbon printmaking and its enduring importance to a new generation of image makers who value the handmade print. </p></span>",

The book emphasizes practical design issues - from high-level behavioural modelling in MATLAB/SIMULINK, to circuit-level implementation in Cadence Design FrameWork II. As well as being a comprehensive reference to the theory, the book is also unique in that it gives special importance on practical issues, giving a detailed description of the different steps that constitute the whole design flow of sigma-delta ADCs.</p><p>The book begins with an introductory survey of sigma-delta modulators, their fundamentals architectures and synthesis methods covered in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, the effect of main circuit error mechanisms is analysed, providing the necessary understanding of the main practical issues affecting the performance of sigma-delta modulators. The knowledge derived from the first two chapters is presented in the book as an essential part of the systematic top-down/bottom-up synthesis methodology of sigma-delta modulators described in Chapter 3, where a time-domain behavioural simulator named SIMSIDES is described and applied to the high-level design and verification of sigma-delta ADCs. Chapter 4 moves farther down from system-level to the circuit and physical level, providing a number of design recommendations and practical recipes to complete the design flow of sigma-delta modulators. To conclude the book, Chapter 5 gives an overview of the state-of-the-art sigma-delta ADCs, which are exhaustively analysed in order to extract practical design guidelines and to identify the incoming trends, design challenges as well as practical solutions proposed by cutting-edge designs.</p><ul><li><p>Offers a complete survey of sigma-delta modulator architectures from fundamentals to state-of-the art topologies, considering both switched-capacitor and continuous-time circuit implementations</p></li><li><p>Gives a systematic analysis and practical design guide of sigma-delta modulators, from a top-down/bottom-up perspective, including mathematical models and analytical procedures, behavioural modeling in MATLAB/SIMULINK, macromodeling, and circuit-level implementation in Cadence Design FrameWork II, chip prototyping, and experimental characterization.</p></li><li><p>Systematic compilation of cutting-edge sigma-delta modulators</p></li><li><p>Complete description of SIMSIDES, a time-domain behavioural simulator implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK</p></li><li><p>Plenty of examples, case studies, and simulation test benches, covering the different stages of the design flow of sigma-delta modulators</p></li><li><p>A number of electronic resources, including SIMSIDES, the statistical data used in the state-of-the-art survey, as well as many design examples and test benches are hosted on a companion website</p></li></ul><p>Essential reading for Researchers and electronics engineering practitioners interested in the design of high-performance data converters integrated in nanometer CMOS technologies; mixed-signal designers.</p></span></span>",

			"title": "Nano-CMOS Gate Dielectric Engineering",
			"description": "<span><p>According to Moore’s Law, not only does the number of transistors in an integrated circuit double every two years, but transistor size also decreases at a predictable rate. At the rate we are going, the downsizing of CMOS transistors will reach the deca-nanometer scale by 2020. Accordingly, the gate dielectric thickness will be shrunk to less than half-nanometer oxide equivalent thickness (EOT) to maintain proper operation of the transistors, leaving high-k materials as the only viable solution for such small-scale EOT. </p><p/><p>This comprehensive, up-to-date text covering the physics, materials, devices, and fabrication processes for high-k gate dielectric materials, <strong>Nano-CMOS Gate Dielectric Engineering</strong> systematically describes how the fundamental electronic structures and other material properties of the transition metals and rare earth metals affect the electrical properties of the dielectric films, the dielectric/silicon and the dielectric/metal gate interfaces, and the resulting device properties. Specific topics include the problems and solutions encountered with high-k material thermal stability, defect density, and poor initial interface with silicon substrate. The text also addresses the essence of thin film deposition, etching, and process integration of high-k materials in an actual CMOS process.</p><p/><p>Fascinating in both content and approach, <strong>Nano-CMOS Gate Dielectric Engineering</strong> explains all of the necessary physics in a highly readable manner and supplements this with numerous intuitive illustrations and tables. Covering almost every aspect of high-k gate dielectric engineering for nano-CMOS technology, this is a perfect reference book for graduate students needing a better understanding of developing technology as well as researchers and engineers needing to get ahead in microelectronic engineering and materials science. </p></span>",

			"title": "Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom",
			"description": "<span><span><div><p>Perhaps the most explosive technological trend over the past two years has been blogging.  As a matter of fact, it's been reported that the number of blogs during that time has grown from 100,000 to 4.8 million-with no end to this growth in sight.What's the technology that makes blogging tick?  The answer is RSS--a format that allows bloggers to offer XML-based feeds of their content.  It's also the same technology that's incorporated into the websites of media outlets so they can offer material (headlines, links, articles, etc.) syndicated by other sites.As the main technology behind this rapidly growing field of content syndication, RSS is constantly evolving to keep pace with worldwide demand.  That's where <i>Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom</i> steps in.  It provides bloggers, web developers, and programmers with a thorough explanation of syndication in general and the most popular technologies used to develop feeds.This book not only highlights all the new features of RSS 2.0-the most recent RSS specification-but also offers complete coverage of its close second in the XML-feed arena, Atom. The book has been exhaustively revised to explain:</p><ul><li>metadata interpretation</li><li>the different forms of content syndication</li><li>the increasing use of web services</li><li>how to use popular RSS news aggregators on the market</li></ul>After an introduction that examines Internet content syndication in general (its purpose, limitations, and traditions), this step-by-step guide tackles various RSS and Atom vocabularies, as well as techniques for applying syndication to problems beyond news feeds.  Most importantly, it gives you a firm handle on how to create your own feeds, and consume or combine other feeds.If you're interested in producing your own content feed, <i>Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom</i> is the one book you'll want in hand.</div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Trade magazines and review articles describe MWD in casual terms, e.g., positive versus negative pulsers, continuous wave systems, drilling channel noise and attenuation, in very simple terms absent of technical rigor.  However, few truly scientific discussions are available on existing methods, let alone the advances necessary for high-data-rate telemetry.  Without a strong foundation building on solid acoustic principles, rigorous mathematics, and of course, fast, inexpensive and efficient testing of mechanical designs, low data rates will impose unacceptable quality issues to real-time formation evaluation for years to come.</p><p>This all-new revised second edition of an instant classic promises to change all of this.  The lead author and M.I.T.-educated scientist, Wilson Chin, has written the <i>only</i> book available that develops mud pulse telemetry from first principles, adapting sound acoustic principles to rigorous signal processing and efficient wind tunnel testing.  In fact, the methods and telemetry principles developed in the book were recently adopted by one of the world’s largest industrial corporations in its mission to redefine the face of MWD.</p> The entire engineering history for continuous wave telemetry is covered: anecdotal stories and their fallacies, original hardware problems and their solutions, different noise mechanisms and their signal processing solutions, apparent paradoxes encountered in field tests and simple explanations to complicated questions, and so on, are discussed in complete “tell all” detail for students, research professors and professional engineers alike.  These include signal processing algorithms, signal enhancement methods, and highly efficient “short” and “long wind tunnel” test methods, whose results can be dynamically re-scaled to real muds flowing at any speed.  A <i>must</i> read for all petroleum engineering professionals!\n  </span>",

			"title": "Microprocessor 5",
			"description": "<span><p><br/>      Since its commercialization in 1971, the microprocessor, a modern and integrated form of the central processing unit, has continuously broken records in terms of its integrated functions, computing power, low costs and energy saving status. Today, it is present in almost all electronic devices. Sound knowledge of its internal mechanisms and programming is essential for electronics and computer engineers to understand and master computer operations and advanced programming concepts. This book in five volumes focuses more particularly on the first two generations of microprocessors, those that handle 4- and 8- bit integers. Microprocessor 5 – the fifth and final volume of this series of books – first presents the hardware and software aspects of the development chain of a microprocessor-based digital system. Finally, to round up the series and offer a historical perspective, the architectures of the first microcomputers are detailed. A comprehensive approach is used, with examples drawn from current and past technologies that illustrate theoretical concepts, making them accessible. <br/>   </p></span>",

			"description": "<span>\nArt of Designing Embedded Systems is apart primer and part reference, aimed at practicing embedded engineers, whether working on the code or the hardware design. Embedded systems suffer from a chaotic, ad hoc development process. This books lays out a very simple seven-step plan to get firmware development under control. There are no formal methodologies to master; the ideas are immediately useful. Most designers are unaware that code complexity grows faster than code size. This book shows a number of ways to linearize the complexity/size curve and get products out faster. Ganssle shows ways to get better code and hardware designs by integrating hardware and software design. He also covers troubleshooting, real time and performance issues, relations with bosses and coworkers, and tips for building an environment for creative work.<br/><br/> Get better systems out faster, using the practical ideas discussed in Art of Designing Embedded Systems. Whether you're working with hardware or software, this book offers a unique philosophy of development guaranteed to keep you interested and learning.<br/><br/>* Practical advice from a well-respected author<br/>* Common-sense approach to better, faster design<br/>* Integrated hardware/software\n</span>",

As a result, they are losing out on emerging opportunities to optimize its use in targeted applications and technologies. In many cases, easily available standard arithmetic hardware might not necessarily be the most efficient implementation strategy.</p><p/><p><strong>Multiple-Base Number System: Theory and Applications</strong> stands apart from the usual books on computer arithmetic with its concentration on the uses and the mathematical operations associated with the recently introduced multiple-base number system (MBNS). The book identifies and explores several diverse and never-before-considered MBNS applications (and their implementation issues) to enhance computation efficiency, specifically in digital signal processing (DSP) and public key cryptography. </p><p>Despite the recent development and increasing popularity of MBNS as a specialized tool for high-performance calculations in electronic hardware and other fields, no single text has compiled all the crucial, cutting-edge information engineers need to optimize its use. The authors’ main goal was to disseminate the results of extensive design research—including much of their own—to help the widest possible audience of engineers, computer scientists, and mathematicians. </p><p/><p>Dedicated to helping readers apply discoveries in advanced integrated circuit technologies, this single reference is packed with a wealth of vital content previously scattered throughout limited-circulation technical and mathematical journals and papers—resources generally accessible only to researchers and designers working in highly specialized fields. Leveling the informational playing field, this resource guides readers through an in-depth analysis of theory, architectural techniques, and the latest research on the subject, subsequently laying the groundwork users require to begin applying MBNS.</p></span>",

Design companies like IDEO and frogdesign are regularly asked to design products that unify software interaction, device design and service design -- which are all the key components of ubiquitous computing UX -- and practicing designers need a way to tackle practical challenges of design. Theory is not enough for them -- luckily the industry is now mature enough to have tried and tested best practices and case studies from the field.</p><p><i>Smart Things</i> presents a problem-solving approach to addressing designers' needs and concentrates on process, rather than technological detail, to keep from being quickly outdated. It pays close attention to the capabilities and limitations of the medium in question and discusses the tradeoffs and challenges of design in a commercial environment. Divided into two sections,  frameworks and techniques, the book discusses broad design methods and case studies that reflect key aspects of these approaches. The book then presents a set of techniques highly valuable to a practicing designer. It is intentionally not a comprehensive tutorial of user-centered design'as that is covered in many other books'but it is a handful of techniques useful when designing ubiquitous computing user experiences.</p><p>In short, <i>Smart Things</i> gives its readers both the \"why\" of this kind of design and the \"how,\" in well-defined chunks. </p><ul><li>Tackles design of products in the post-Web world where computers no longer have to be monolithic, expensive general-purpose devices</li><li>Features broad frameworks and processes, practical advice to help approach specifics, and techniques for the unique design challenges</li><li>Presents case studies that describe, in detail, how others have solved problems, managed trade-offs, and met successes</li></ul></span>",

While cryogenic cooling and precision materials manufacture is required to achieve this goal, cost reductions without significant performance loss are being achieved through the advanced design and development of HTS wires, cables and magnets, along with improvements in manufacturing methods. This book explores the fundamental principles, design and development of HTS materials and their practical applications in energy systems.<br/><br/>Part one describes the fundamental science, engineering and development of particular HTS components such as wires and tapes, cables, coils and magnets and discusses the cryogenics and electromagnetic modelling of HTS systems and materials. Part two reviews the types of energy applications that HTS materials are used in, including fault current limiters, power cables and energy storage, as well as their application in rotating machinery for improved electrical efficiencies, and in fusion technologies and accelerator systems where HTS magnets are becoming essential enabling technologies.<br/><br/>With its distinguished editor and international team of expert contributors, High temperature superconductors (HTS) for energy applications is an invaluable reference tool for anyone involved or interested in HTS materials and their application in energy systems, including materials scientists and electrical engineers, energy consultants, HTS materials manufacturers and designers, and researchers and academics in this field.<br/><br/><ul><li>Discusses fundamental issues and developments of particular HTS components</li><li>Comprehensively reviews the design and development of HTS materials and then applications in energy systems</li><li>Reviews the use of HTS materials and cabling transmissions, fault alignment limiters, energy storage, generators and motors, fusion and accelerator</li></ul></span>",

It also covers the use of AC analysis to calculate the frequency and phase response of a circuit and DC analysis to calculate the circuits bias point over a range of values.</p><p>The book describes a parametric sweep, which involves sweeping a parameter through a range of values, along with the use of Stimulus Editor to define transient analog and digital sources. It also examines the failure of simulations due to circuit errors and missing or incorrect parameters, and discusses the use of Monte Carlo analysis to estimate the response of a circuit when device model parameters are randomly varied between specified tolerance limits according to a specified statistical distribution. Other chapters focus on the use of worst-case analysis to identify the most critical components that will affect circuit performance, how to add and create PSpice models, and how the frequency-related signal and dispersion losses of transmission lines affect the signal integrity of high-speed signals via the transmission lines.</p><p>Practitioners, researchers, and those interested in using the Cadence/OrCAD professional simulation software to design and analyze electronic circuits will find the information, methods, compounds, and experiments described in this book extremely useful. </p><ul><li>Provides both a comprehensive user guide, and a detailed overview of simulation</li><li>Each chapter has worked and ready to try sample designs and provides a wide range of to-do exercises</li><li>Core skills are developed using a running case study circuit</li><li>Covers Capture and PSpice together for the first time</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Whether you know them as \"rapid prototyping,\" \"additive manufacturing,\" or some other buzzword, the processes, technologies, and tools of 3D printing are developing at such a rapid pace that it's easy to be overwhelmed or confused by the ever-increasing range of options. This report helps demystify the field of 3D printing, by outlining the strengths and liabilities of the different types of processes that are currently available, along with an indication of advancements to be on the lookout for in the near future.<br/><br/>Because there are many ways to \"3D print\" an object, this report focuses on distinctions between the various methods (including lithography-based methods, robot-controlled extrusion methods, powder-bed methods, and a few more exotic processes), providing examples of each process in the commercial, consumer, and DIY/open source markets. Rather than promote or endorse a particular make or model of 3D printer (or type of printer), the purpose of this survey is to help identify the right type of printer for particular uses, narrowing the field to a more manageable number of candidates. You'll also learn about concerns and limitations that apply to all methods, which will help inform your selection process when searching for the perfect 3D printer for your needs.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>A new and innovative paradigm for RF frequency synthesis and wireless transmitter design</b></p><p>Learn the techniques for designing and implementing an all-digital RF frequency synthesizer. In contrast to traditional RF techniques, this innovative book sets forth digitally intensive design techniques that lead the way to the development of low-cost, low-power, and highly integrated circuits for RF functions in deep submicron CMOS processes. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate how the architecture enables readers to integrate an RF front-end with the digital back-end onto a single silicon die using standard ASIC design flow.</p><p>Taking a bottom-up approach that progressively builds skills and knowledge, the book begins with an introduction to basic concepts of frequency synthesis and then guides the reader through an all-digital RF frequency synthesizer design:</p><ul><li><p>Chapter 2 presents a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO), which is the foundation of a novel architecture, and introduces a time-domain model used for analysis and VHDL simulation</p></li><li><p>Chapter 3 adds a hierarchical layer of arithmetic abstraction to the DCO that makes it easier to operate algorithmically</p></li><li><p>Chapter 4 builds a phase correction mechanism around the DCO such that the system's frequency drift or wander performance matches that of the stable external frequency reference</p></li><li><p>Chapter 5 presents an application of the all-digital RF synthesizer</p></li><li><p>Chapter 6 describes the behavioral modeling and simulation methodology used in design</p></li><li><p>The final chapter presents the implementation of a full transmitter and experimental results. The novel ideas presented here have been implemented and proven in two high-volume, commercial single-chip radios developed at Texas Instruments: Bluetooth and GSM.</p></li></ul><p>While the focus of the book is on RF frequency synthesizer design, the techniques can be applied to the design of other digitally assisted analog circuits as well. This book is a must-read for students and engineers who want to learn a new paradigm for RF frequency synthesis and wireless transmitter design using digitally intensive design techniques.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Arthur C. Clarke famously wrote in 1961, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" In the next issue of MAKE (Vol. 23) we'll show you the technology sufficient to make things that seem like magic. In this special GADGETS issue, devoted to machines that do delightful and surprising things, we'll show you how to make the following:  a magic suitcase that contains an animated soothsayer, an electromagnetic gadget that shoots aluminum rings, a clever wooden gear mechanism invented by Renaissance gadgetmaster Leonardo Da Vinci, a miniature electronic Whack-a-Mole arcade game, a tiny but mighty audio amplifier, and a creepy mechanical box that's only purpose is to turn itself off. All this and much, much more in MAKE Vol. 23.<br/><br/>MAKE continues to be a leader in the tech DIY movement due to its uncanny instinct to engage the curiosity, vitality, and passion of the growing community of Makers -- DIY enthusiasts, hobbyist engineers/designers, and others who like to tweak, disassemble, recreate, and invent cool new uses for technology in amazing projects they undertake in their backyards, basements, and garages.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p><b>Create a more effective system for evaluating online faculty</b></p><p><em>Evaluating Online Teaching</em> is the first comprehensive book to outline strategies for effectively measuring the quality of online teaching, providing the tools and guidance that faculty members and administrators need. The authors address challenges that colleges and universities face in creating effective online teacher evaluations, including organizational structure, institutional governance, faculty and administrator attitudes, and possible budget constraints. Through the integration of case studies and theory, the text provides practical solutions geared to address challenges and foster effective, efficient evaluations of online teaching. Readers gain access to rubrics, forms, and worksheets that they can customize to fit the needs of their unique institutions.</p><p>Evaluation methods designed for face-to-face classrooms, from student surveys to administrative observations, are often applied to the online teaching environment, leaving reviewers and instructors with an ill-fitted and incomplete analysis. Evaluating Online Teaching shows how strategies for evaluating online teaching differ from those used in traditional classrooms and vary as a function of the nature, purpose, and focus of the evaluation. This book guides faculty members and administrators in crafting an evaluation process specifically suited to online teaching and learning, for more accurate feedback and better results. Readers will:</p><li><p>Learn how to evaluate online teaching performance</p></li><li><p>Examine best practices for student ratings of online teaching</p></li><li><p>Discover methods and tools for gathering informal feedback</p></li><li><p>Understand the online teaching evaluation life cycle</p></li><p>The book concludes with an examination of strategies for fostering change across campus, as well as structures for creating a climate of assessment that includes online teaching as a component. <em>Evaluating Online Teaching</em> helps institutions rethink the evaluation process for online teaching, with the end goal of improving teaching and learning, student success, and institutional results.</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><br>Microprocessor Based Systems for the Higher Technician provides coverage of the BTEC level 4 unit in Microprocessor Based Systems (syllabus U80/674).  This book is composed of 10 chapters and concentrates on the development of 8-bit microcontrollers specifically constructed around the Z80 microprocessor. The design cycle for the development of such a microprocessor based system and the use of a disk-based development system (MDS) as an aid to design are both described in detail. The book deals with the Control Program Monitor (CP/M) operating system and gives background information on file handling. Programming is given attention through a thorough explanation of software development tools and the use of macros. Choosing devices from the Z80 family of processors, the author explains hardware development including topics on basic circuits for each stage of development in resonance with the applicable data sheets. When software and hardware are to be integrated and function efficiently, a technique called emulation may prove useful; hence it is also described. The book ends with troubleshooting or fault location, especially for computer systems that are still under development and riddled with bugs. Troubleshooting or fault location, which is considered an acquired skill, is improved with discussions on basic techniques, principles of operation, and the equipment needed for a successful diagnosis and solution of the problem.  Software engineers, computer technicians, computer engineers, teachers, and instructors in the field of computing learning will find this book very instructive. The book can also be read by computer enthusiasts who desire to have an advanced technical know-how and understanding of computer hardware and systems.<br></p></span>",

Other factors become fundamental, such as time to market, convenience, energy efficiency, and ease of customization. This book is the first to explore comprehensively one of the most fundamental trends which emerged in the last decade: to treat processors not as rigid, fixed entities, which designers include \"as is\" in their products; but rather, to build sound methodologies to tailor-fit processors to the specific needs of such products. This book addresses the goal of maintaining a very large family of processors, with a wide range of features, at a cost comparable to that of maintaining a single processor.</p></span></span></span>",

This allows metals, ceramics, polymers and biological materials (including living cells) to be patterned on to substrates under precise digital control. This approach offers huge potential advantages for manufacturing, since inkjet methods can be used to generate structures and functions which cannot be attained in other ways.</p><p>Beginning with an overview of the fundamentals, this bookcovers the key components, for example piezoelectric print-heads and fluids for inkjet printing, and the processes involved. It goes on to describe specific applications, e.g. MEMS, printed circuits, active and passive electronics, biopolymers and living cells, and additive manufacturing. Detailed case studies are included on flat-panel OLED displays, RFID (radio-frequency identification) manufacturing and tissue engineering, while a comprehensive examination of the current technologies and future directions of inkjet technology completes the coverage.</p><p>With contributions from both academic researchers and leading names in the industry, <em>Inkjet Technology for Digital Fabrication</em> is a comprehensive resource for technical development engineers, researchers and students in inkjet technology and system development, and will also appeal to researchers in chemistry, physics, engineering, materials science and electronics.</p></span></span></span>",

IP has successfully demonstrated the ability to interconnect billions of digital systems on the global Internet and in private IP networks. Once smart objects can be easily interconnected, a whole new class of smart object systems can begin to evolve. The book discusses how IP-based smart object networks are being designed and deployed.</p><p>The book is organized into three parts. Part 1 demonstrates why the IP architecture is well suited to smart object networks, in contrast to non-IP based sensor network or other proprietary systems that interconnect to IP networks (e.g. the public Internet of private IP networks) via hard-to-manage and expensive multi-protocol translation gateways that scale poorly. Part 2 examines protocols and algorithms, including smart objects and the low power link layers technologies used in these networks. Part 3 describes the following smart object network applications: smart grid, industrial automation, smart cities and urban networks, home automation, building automation, structural health monitoring, and container tracking.</p><ul><li>Shows in detail how connecting smart objects impacts our lives with practical implementation examples and case studies </li><li>Provides an in depth understanding of the technological and architectural aspects underlying smart objects technology </li><li>Offers an in-depth examination of relevant IP protocols to build large scale smart object networks in support of a myriad of new services </li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>\"Self-forgetfulness is the reigning temptation of the technological era. This is why we so readily give our assent to the absurd proposition that a computer can add two plus two, despite the obvious fact that it can do nothing of the sort--not if we have in mind anything remotely resembling what we do when we add numbers. In the computer's case, the mechanics of addition involve no motivation, no consciousness of the task, no mobilization of the will, no metabolic activity, no imagination. And its performance brings neither the satisfaction of accomplishment nor the strengthening of practical skills and cognitive capacities.\"<br/><br/>In this insightful book, author Steve Talbott, software programmer and technical writer turned researcher and editor for The Nature Institute, challenges us to step back and take an objective look at the technology driving our lives. At a time when 65 percent of American consumers spend more time with their PCs than they do with their significant others, according to a recent study, Talbott illustrates that we're forgetting one important thing--our Selves, the human spirit from which technology stems.<br/><br/>Whether we're surrendering intimate details to yet another database, eschewing our physical communities for online social networks, or calculating our net worth, we freely give our power over to technology until, he says, \"we arrive at a computer's-eye view of the entire world of industry, commerce, and society at large...an ever more closely woven web of programmed logic.\"<br/><br/>Digital technology certainly makes us more efficient. But when efficiency is the only goal, we have no way to know whether we're going in the right or wrong direction. Businesses replace guiding vision with a spreadsheet's bottom line. Schoolteachers are replaced by the computer's dataflow. Indigenous peoples give up traditional skills for the dazzle and ease of new gadgets. Even the Pentagon's zeal to replace \"boots on the ground\" with technology has led to the mess in Iraq. And on it goes.<br/><br/>The ultimate danger is that, in our willingness to adapt ourselves to technology, \"we will descend to the level of the computational devices we have engineered--not merely imagining ever new and more sophisticated automatons, but reducing ourselves to automatons.\"<br/><br/>To transform our situation, we need to see it in a new and unaccustomed light, and that's what Talbott provides by examining the deceiving virtues of technology--how we're killing education, socializing our machines, and mechanizing our society.Once you take this eye-opening journey, you will think more clearly about how you consume technology and how you allow it to consume you.<br/><br/>\"Nothing is as rare or sorely needed in our tech-enchanted culture right now as intelligent criticism of technology, and Steve Talbott is exactly the critic we've been waiting for: trenchant, sophisticated, and completely original. Devices of the Soul is an urgent and important book.\"<br/><br/>--Michael Pollan, author of <i>The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals</i> and <i>The Botany of Desire: A Plant's Eye View of the World</i><br/><br/>\"Steve Talbott is a rare voice of clarity, humanity, and passion in a world enthralled by machines and calculation. His new book, Devices of the Soul, lays out a frightening and at the same time inspiring analysis of what computers and computer-like thinking are doing to us, our children, and the future of our planet. Talbott is no Luddite. He fully understands and appreciates the stunning power of technology for both good and evil. His cool and precise skewering of the fuzzy thinking and mindless enthusiasm of the technology true believers is tempered by his modesty, the elegance of his writing, and his abiding love for the world of nature and our capacity for communion with it. \"<br/><br/>--Edward Miller, Former editor, Harvard Education Letter<br/><br/>\"Those who care about the healthy and wholesome lives of children can gain much from Steve Talbott's wisdom. He examines the need to help children spend more time touching nature and real life and less touching keyboards. He eloquently questions the assumption that speeding up learning is a good thing. Is, after all, a sped-up life a well-lived life? Most importantly, he reminds all of us that technology is just one part of life and ought not to overshadow the life of self and soul.\"<br/><br/>--Joan Almon, Coordinator, Alliance for Childhood<br/><br/>\"One of the most original and provocative writers of our time, Steve Talbott offers a rich assortment of insightful reflections on the nature of our humanity, challenging our own thinking and conventional wisdom about advances in technology.\"<br/><br/>--Dorothy E. Denning, Department of Defense Analysis, Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, CA<br/><br/>\"Are you experiencing growing unease as computational metaphors have seized our discourse? Steve Talbott offers immediate relief. You are not losing your mind! Chapter after chapter, he shows how to draw on the powers of technology without losing your soul or breaking your heart.\"<br/><br/>--Peter Denning, Past President of ACM, Monterey, California<br/><br/>\"Steve Talbott is a rare writer whose words can alter one's entire perception of the world. He is our most original and perceptive defender of the wholeness of life against the onslaught of mechanism. Devices of the Soul is written with Talbott's typical grace and clarity. It displays a quality hardly found anymore in our high tech culture--wisdom. \"<br/><br/>--Lowell Monke, Associate Professor of Education, Wittenberg University</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span>\nProgramming for Microprocessors deals with the basics of programming for microprocessors and contains practical aids to programming. Topics covered range from assembly language and microprocessor design to the Motorola 6800, programming techniques, control of peripheral devices, and high-level languages. Emphasis is given to the computer-like aspects of microprocessors. <br/>This text is comprised of 12 chapters; the first of which provides a general overview of microprocessors, differences between hardwired and programmed devices, and different kinds of microprocessors. The reader is then introduced to the basic types of information inside a microprocessor, including Boolean information, numerical information, character codes, and the machine code. The chapters that follow focus on the intellectual and practical tools that the designer of a microprocessor system will need. The basic structure of a microprocessor is analyzed, with particular reference to a simple hypothetical computer and some programs for this machine. This book also discusses assembly language; some of the features that give microprocessors their flexibility as well as generality and power; and the Motorola 6800 microprocessor as an example of machine architecture. Some programming techniques, high-level languages for writing programs, and the problem of bringing the hardware and software together are highlighted. <br/>This book will be useful to computer programmers, computer scientists, and electronic engineers.\n</span>",

			"title": "Bluetooth Application Programming with the Java APIs Essentials Edition",
			"description": "<span>\nAdoption of Bluetooth wireless technology has become ubiquitous in the last few years. One of the biggest steps forward is the standardization of Java APIs for Bluetooth wireless technology (JABWT). The latest updates to this standard is explained in detail in this book. The JABWT standard, defined by the JSR-82 Java Specification Request, supports rapid development of Bluetooth applications that are portable, secure, and highly-usable. Wireless device manufacturers have responded overwhelmingly to the JABWT specification by implementing JABWT applications in mobile phones and other personal wireless communications products. <br/><br/><i>Bluetooth Application Programming Essentials: Programming with the Java APIs</i> explains in detail how to write Bluetooth applications using the Java APIs to exploit the power of both technologies. Written by the specification lead for JSR-82 and two other key participants in developing the standards of JABWT, this book provides the authoritative explanations and concrete examples needed to get started right away.<br/><br/>This book provides embedded Java developers with to-the-point information on the APIs in the specification with detailed programmatic examples of the APIs in use. A NEW chapter on the Push Registry definition (a new feature in the 1.1 version of JSR-82) has been added. Finally, the new Essentials version of the book will update the remaining chapters to reflect changes in the latest Bluetooth spec (2.1) and the industry as a whole.<ul><li>By focusing only on the essentials, this concise resource enables software and hardware vendors to quickly develop Bluetooth applications for mobile devices in an increasingly competitive market. </li><li>The updated material examines crucial programming areas (including RFCOMM, OBEX, device discovery, service discovery, and L2CAP), which allows developers to not only successfully design, but master and build Java APIs for Bluetooth Wireless Technology.</li><li>Includes a new and valuable chapter that delineates the pivotal Push Registry feature - a recent development that will help programmers avoid the common problem of connection collision.</li><li>By providing real-world issues and problems involved in implementing the Java APIs specification, the book allows developers to identify with the text and encourages repeated reference.   </li></ul>\n</span>",

However, the big goal in this book is to create a shift in the reader’s mindset, where weekend hacks are pushed to the next level and are treated as products to be deployed. In that regard, this book can be a stepping stone for hobbyist makers into developing a broader, professional skill set. </p><p> </p><p>First, the book describes techniques for creating web-browser based dashboards for projects. These allow project creators to monitor, control, and troubleshoot their projects in real-time. Project Reliability Engineering discusses various aspects of the process of creating a web dashboard, such as network communication protocols, multithreading, and web design, and data visualization. </p><p> </p><p>Later chapters cover configuration of the project and the machine it’s running on, and additional techniques for project monitoring and diagnosis. These include good logging practices; automatic log and metrics monitoring; and alerting via email and text messages;  </p><p> </p><p>A mixture of advanced concepts forms the last chapter of the book, touching on topics such as usage of microservices in complex projects; debugging techniques for object-oriented projects; and fail-safing the project’s software and hardware. </p><p> <b>What You’ll Learn</b></p><ul>  Monitor      and control projects, keep them up and running, and troubleshoot them      efficiently  <li>Get      acquainted with available tools and libraries, and learn how to make your      own tools</li> <li>Expand      your knowledge in Python, JavaScript and Linux</li> <li>Develop      deeper understanding of web technologies</li> <li>Design      robust and complex systems</li> </ul><p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p><p>Members of the maker community with some development skills.</p><br/></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are extensively used in industry to perform automation tasks, with manufacturers offering a variety of PLCs that differ in functions, program memories, and the number of inputs/outputs (I/O). Not surprisingly, the design and implementation of these PLCs have long been a secret of manufacturers. Unveiling the mysteries of PLC technology, <strong>Building a Programmable Logic Controller with PIC16F648A Microcontroller </strong>explains how to design and use a PIC16F648A-microcontroller-based PLC. </p><br/><br/><p>The author first described a microcontroller-based implementation of a PLC in a series of articles published in <em>Electronics World</em> magazine between 2008 and 2010. This book is based on an improved version of the project, including:</p><br/><br/><ul><br/><br/><li>Updates to the hardware configuration, with a smaller CPU board and two I/O extension boards that now support 16 inputs and 16 outputs instead of 8</li><br/><br/><li>An increased clock frequency of 20 MHz</li><br/><br/><li>Improvements to several macros</li><br/><br/><li>Flowcharts to help you understand the macros (functions)</li></ul><br/><br/><p>In this book, the author provides detailed explanations of hardware and software structures. He also describes PIC Assembly macros for all basic PLC functions, which are illustrated with numerous examples and flowcharts. An accompanying downloadable resources contain source files (.ASM) and object files (.HEX) for all of the examples in the book. It also supplies printed circuit board (PCB) (Gerber and .pdf) files so that you can have the CPU board and I/O extension boards produced by a PCB manufacturer or produce your own boards.</p><br/><br/><p>Making PLCs more easily accessible, this unique book is written for advanced students, practicing engineers, and hobbyists who want to learn how to build their own microcontroller-based PLC. It assumes some previous knowledge of digital logic design, microcontrollers, and PLCs, as well as familiarity with the PIC16F series of microcontrollers and w</p></span>",

			"title": "Automated Physical Database Design and Tuning",
			"description": "<span><p>Due to the increasing complexity in application workloads and query engines, database administrators are turning to automated tuning tools that systematically explore the space of physical design alternatives. A critical element of such tuning is physical database design since the choice of physical structures has a significant impact on the performance of the database system. <strong>Automated Physical Database Design and Tuning</strong> presents a detailed overview of the fundamental ideas and algorithms for automatically recommending changes to the physical design of a database system.</p><p/><p>The first part of the book introduces the necessary technical background. The author explains SQL, the space of execution plans for answering SQL queries, query optimization, how the choice of access paths (e.g., indexes) is crucial to performance, and the complexity of the physical design problem.</p><p/><p>The second part extensively discusses automated physical design techniques, covering fundamental research ideas in the last 15 years that have resulted in a new generation of tuning tools. The text focuses on the search space of alternatives, the necessity of a cost model to compare such alternatives, different mechanisms to traverse and enumerate the search space, and practical aspects in real-world tuning tools.</p><p/><p>In the third part, the author explores new advances in automated physical design. He applies previous approaches to other physical structures, such as materialized views, partitioning, and multidimensional clustering. He also analyzes workload models for new types of applications, generalizes the optimizing function of current physical design tools to cope with other application scenarios, and examines open-ended challenges in physical database design.</p><p/><p>This book offers valuable insights on well-established principles and cutting-edge research results in automated physical design. It helps readers gain a deeper understanding of how automated tuning tools work in database installations as well as the challenges and opportunities involved in designing next-generation tuning tools.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>The power industry is undergoing an significant transformation toward smart energy. Internet-connected smart devices to regulate and save energy are certainly part of the picture, but as this comprehensive O’Reilly report explains, the key piece is the emergence of reliable energy-storage solutions. Today, people can outfit their homes, factories, and offices with rechargeable lithium-ion batteries from Tesla and other companies to store energy from any power source.</p><p>Author Darren Beck describes how energy storage changes the game for renewable energy, which up until now has been a niche player because of its intermittent supply. Homeowners and businesses will be able to produce their own clean energy and share it on the grid. It’s the beginning, Beck says, of decentralized energy production that can not only reduce the use of fossil fuels—drastically—but also set up a vast network of distributed storage. And it’s coming sooner rather than later.</p><p>Download this report to learn:</p><ul><li>Why Tesla has spurred interest in energy storage—and why the company open-sourced its patents for the technology</li><li>What a network of distributed storage will look like</li><li>How smart meters can track energy demand across the grid in real time</li><li>How peer-to-peer business models can be used in a sharing economy for energy</li><li>Why owners of multi-tenant properties can set up micro virtual utilities</li><li>How consumers can store electricity when the cleanest energy choices come online</li></ul><p>Darren Beck has more 25 years of combined experience in business development, strategy, technology, and sustainability. In addition to writing about green practices in IoT for O’Reilly Media, Darren serves as Director of Environmental Initiatives for Sprint, and is as an Advisory Board Member for DaVinci Global, an organization designed to be the world’s leading source of insights into nature-inspired design for innovation, business, and finance.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>A novel approach to decision engineering, with a verified framework for modeling human reasoning</b></p><p><i>Soft Computing Evaluation Logic</i> provides an in-depth examination of evaluation decision problems and presents comprehensive guidance toward the use of the Logic Scoring of Preference (LSP) method in modeling complex decision criteria. Fully aligned with current developments in computational intelligence, the discussion covers the design and use of LSP criteria for evaluation and comparison in diverse areas, such as search engines, medical conditions, real estate, space management, habitat mitigation projects in ecology, and land use and residential development suitability maps, with versatile transfer to other similar decision-modeling contexts.</p><p>Human decision making is rife with fuzziness, imprecision, uncertainty, and half-truths—yet humans make evaluation decisions every day. In this book, such decision processes are observed, analyzed, and modeled. The result is <i>graded logic</i>, a soft computing mathematical infrastructure that provides both formal logic and semantic generalizations of classical Boolean logic. Graded logic is used for logic aggregation in the context of evaluation models consistent with observable properties of human reasoning.  The LSP method, based on graded logic and logic aggregation, is a vital component of an industrial-strength decision engineering framework. Thus, the book:</p><ul><li>Provides detailed theoretical background for graded logic</li><li>Provides a theory of logic aggregators</li><li>Explains the LSP method for designing complex evaluation criteria and their use</li><li>Shows techniques for evaluation, comparison, and selection of complex systems, as well as the cost/suitability analysis, optimization, sensitivity analysis, tradeoff analysis, and missingness-tolerant aggregation</li><li>Includes a survey of available LSP software tools, including ISEE, ANSY and LSP.NT.</li></ul><p>With quantitative modeling of human reasoning, novel approaches to modeling decision criteria, and a verified decision engineering framework applicable to a broad array of applications, this book is an invaluable resource for graduate students, researchers, and practitioners working within the decision engineering realm.</p></span>",

It’s a daunting question. But in today’s environment, where change is the only constant, it’s a question everyone must answer. This is true whether you are an innovator or an entrepreneur, a manager or a newly minted graduate.<br/><br/>The first step, say the authors of this book, is this: “Just start.” In other words, take action now and learn as you go.<br/><br/>Written by a trio of seasoned business leaders, <em>Just Start</em> combines fascinating research with proven practices to deliver a reliable method for helping you advance toward your goals—despite the uncertainty that is all too common today. Babson College President Leonard Schlesinger, organizational learning expert Charles Kiefer, and veteran journalist Paul B. Brown share their own deep and varied experiences and draw from a source where striving amid constant uncertainty actually works: the world of serial entrepreneurship. In this world, people don’t just think differently—they act differently, as well.<br/><br/>Using this novel approach, <em>Just Start</em> will help you: <br/><br/>•\tDetermine the best strategy and tactics when the future is uncertain<br/>•\tMinimize financial risk in every decision you make<br/>•\tAttract like-minded people to what you want to do (and learn why this is important)<br/>•\tUnderstand why “Act. Learn. Build (so you can) Act again” is the best course of action when facing the unknown<br/><br/>So throw out your forecasting tools and shrug off that nagging frustration that comes with constant uncertainty. <em>Just Start</em> distills for you the very essence of what makes people successful in today’s volatile environment. This book is your guide to achieving your goals—whether your project is professional or personal, or somewhere in between.</div></span>",

This doesn't offer\nmuch visual or emotional impact.<br/>\n<br/>\nCreate an image that captures the <em>spirit</em> of a family –\nas well as the individualism of the members – and you start\nat a magical place. That family now feels something when they view\nthe photograph.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Tamara Lackey's <em>Envisioning Family: A photographer's guide to\nmaking meaningful portraits of the modern family,</em> Lackey\nreinvents the family photo for photographers. A top portrait\nphotographer and sought-after speaker, Lackey reveals her\ntechniques for getting each member of the family to feel at home in\nfront of the camera – whether they're in her studio, at home,\nor on location.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith this book you'll learn how to use backgrounds that complement\nyour subjects, set up and shoot in-studio, light your images\nanywhere with straightforward lighting setups and diagrams, pose\nyour subjects in a beautiful but natural way, nail your exposure,\nand create meaningful family portraits that leave everyone feeling\nand looking their honest best.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor professional portrait photographers looking to inject some new\nvitality into their work or aspiring family photographers who would\nlike to take more authentic images, this guide will help capture\nthe modern family.<br/></p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><em>Android on x86: an Introduction to Optimizing for Intel® Architecture</em> serves two main purposes.  First, it makes the case for adapting your applications onto Intel's x86 architecture, including discussions of the business potential, the changing landscape of the Android marketplace, and the unique challenges and opportunities that arise from x86 devices.  The fundamental idea is that extending your applications to support x86 or creating new ones is not difficult, but it is imperative to know all of the technicalities. This book is dedicated to providing you with an awareness of these nuances and an understanding of how to tackle them.</p><p>Second, and most importantly, this book provides a one-stop detailed resource for best practices and procedures associated with the installation issues, hardware optimization issues, software requirements, programming tasks, and performance optimizations that emerge when developers consider the x86 Android devices. Optimization discussions dive into native code, hardware acceleration, and advanced profiling of multimedia applications. The authors have collected this information so that you can use the book as a guide for the specific requirements of each application project.</p><p>This book is not dedicated solely to code; instead it is filled with the information you need in order to take advantage of x86 architecture.  It will guide you through installing the Android SDK for Intel Architecture, help you understand the differences and similarities between processor architectures available in Android devices, teach you to create and port applications, debug existing x86 applications, offer solutions for NDK and C++ optimizations, and introduce the Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager. This book provides the most useful information to help you get the job done quickly while utilizing best practices.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>The development-relevant differences between Android on ARM and Android on Intel x86</p></li><li><p>How to set up the SDK for an emulated Intel Android device</p></li><li><p>How to build the Android OS for the Intel Mobile Processor</p></li><li><p>How to create new x86 based Android applications, set up testing and performance tuning, and port existing Android applications to work with the x86 processor</p></li><li><p>How to debug problems they encounter when working on the x86 Android test platform</p></li><li><p>Intricacies of the Intel Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager. The reader will also gain significant insight into the OpenGL Android support.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><li><p>Android developers</p></li><li><p>Hardware designers who need to understand how Android will work on their processors</p></li><li><p>CIOs and CEOs of technology-based companies</p></li><li><p>IT staff who may encounter or need to understand the issues</p></li><li><p>New startup founders and entrepreneurs</p></li><li><p>Computer science students</p></li></span></span>",

You Don't Have to Do It Alone Alone is the Swiss Army Knife of involvement—a set of tools that can be used in any setting to get you the help you need. The authors lay out a simple, straightforward plan for involving others to get things done, detailing a practical five-step involvement process that begins with five key questions:<br/> <br/>What kind of involvement is needed?<br/>How do I know who to include?<br/>How do I invite people to become involved?<br/>How do I keep people involved?<br/>How do I finish the job?<br/><br/>The answers to these questions serve as a guide to finding the right people and keeping them energized, enthusiastic, and committed until the work is completed. Real life examples from corporations, government, and nonprofits illustrate the process in action.  You'll learn to involve others in a way that will actually make your work easier, resulting in less stress, better ideas, and more successful outcomes. <br/>\n  </span>",

But the threat of danger can also be a trap, holding us back from experiencing many wonders of the world, trying new things, going where no one has gone before. <br/><br/>In MAKE Volume 35, we confront danger within the world of making, and how to be smarter about risk. We examine safe practices for makers, and we look at the illusion of danger vs. real danger, how to use common sense, and how to educate yourself to work more safely and productively.<br/><br/>We're bringing plenty of fire, lightning bolts, and rocket's red glare, too. Guest contributor and celebrated pyromaniac William Gurstelle, author of the best-selling <i>Backyard Ballistics</i> and <i>Whoosh, Boom, Splat</i>, will show us how to make a rocket out of sugar, a tornado out of fire, and a cannon out of dry ice. And Arc Attack member Craig Newswanger shows us how to build the awesome  Six-Pack Tesla Coil, made with a beer-bottle capacitor, that’ll throw 15” electrical arcs.<br/><br/>Other fun, and 100% safety-approved projects include:</p><ul><li>How to make a phonograph out of Lego bricks</li><li>A light-up hoodie from Electroluminescent (EL) wire</li><li>An impressive \"high-gain\" home media projection screen using little more than latex house paint and sandblasting glass</li></ul>All this, along with the latest developments in maker tech--hardware, software and tools for 3D printing, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, robotics--and much, much more.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span>\n    Building the Future<br/><br/>Machiavelli famously wrote, “There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.”<br/><br/>That's what this book is about—innovation far more audacious than a new way to find a restaurant or a smart phone you can wear on your wrist. Amy C. Edmondson and Susan Salter Reynolds explore large-scale systemic innovation that calls for “big teaming”: intense collaboration between professions and industries with completely different mindsets. This demands leadership combining an expansive vision with deliberative incremental action—not an easy balance. <br/><br/>To explore the kind of leadership required to build the future we need, Edmondson and Reynolds tell the story of Living PlanIT. This award-winning “smart city” start-up was launched with a breathtakingly ambitious goal: creating a showcase high-tech city from scratch to pilot its software—quite literally setting out to build the future. This meant a joint effort spanning a truly disparate group of software entrepreneurs, real estate developers, city government officials, architects, construction companies, and technology corporations. By taking a close look at the work, norms, and values in each of these professional domains, we gain new insight into why teaming across fields is so challenging. And we get to know Living PlanIT's leaders, following them and their partners through cycles of hope, exhaustion, disillusionment, pragmatism, and renewal. There are powerful lessons here for anyone, in any industry, seeking to drive audacious innovation.<br/>\n  </span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>The smart grid initiative, integrating advanced sensing technologies, intelligent control methods, and bi-directional communications into the contemporary electricity grid, offers excellent opportunities for energy efficiency improvements and better integration of distributed generation, coexisting with centralized generation units within an active network. A large share of the installed capacity for recent renewable energy sources already comprises insular electricity grids, since the latter are preferable due to their high potential for renewables. </p><p>However, the increasing share of renewables in the power generation mix of insular power systems presents a significant challenge to efficient management of the insular distribution networks, mainly due to the variability and uncertainty of renewable generation. More than other electricity grids, insular electricity grids require the incorporation of sustainable resources and the maximization of the integration of local resources, as well as specific solutions to cope with the inherent characteristics of renewable generation. Insular power systems need a new generation of methodologies and tools to face the new paradigm of large-scale renewable integration.</p><b>\n</b><p>Smart and Sustainable Power Systems: Operations, Planning, and Economics of Insular Electricity Grids discusses the modeling, simulation, and optimization of insular power systems to address the effects of large-scale integration of renewables and demand-side management. This practical book:</p><ul><li>Describes insular power systems, renewable energies, uncertainty, variability, reserves, and demand response</li><li>Examines state-of-the-art forecasting techniques, power flow calculations, and scheduling models</li><li>Covers probabilistic and stochastic approaches, scenario generation, and short-term operation</li><li>Includes comprehensive testing and validation of the mathematical models using real-world data</li><li>Explores electric price signals, competitive operation of distribution networks, and network expansion planning</li></ul><p><b>Smart and Sustainable Power Systems: Operations, Planning, and Economics of Insular Electricity Grids </b>provides a valuable resource for the design of efficient methodologies, tools, and solutions for the development of a truly sustainable and smart grid.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Crystalline semiconductors in the form of thin films are crucial materials for many modern, advanced technologies in fields such as microelectronics, optoelectronics, display technology, and photovoltaic technology. Crystalline semiconductors can be produced at surprisingly low temperatures (as low as 120 ˚C) by crystallization of amorphous semiconductors, which are put in contact with a metal. This so-called metal-induced crystallization process has attracted great scientific and technological interest because it allows the production of crystalline semiconductor-based advanced devices at very low temperatures, for example, directly on low-cost (but often heat-sensitive) substrates.</p><p/><p>This book provides the first comprehensive and in-depth overview of the current fundamental understanding of the metal-induced crystallization process and further elucidates how to employ this process in different technologies, for example, in thin-film solar cells and display technologies. It aims to give the reader a comprehensive perspective of the metal-induced crystallization process and thereby stimulate the development of novel crystalline semiconductor-based technologies.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Silicon is an abundant element and is produced in large quantities for the electronic industry. The falling price of this commodity also feeds the growth of solar photovoltaics (PV). However, solar cells (SCs) based on bulk semiconductors have quite limited maximum attainable performance. Therefore, new principles and materials are being investigated to build the third generation of SCs with improved conversion efficiency achieved by the optimized harvesting of the solar spectrum, improved carrier generation, better light management, etc. The unique properties of semiconductor nanostructures (tuning of optoelectronic properties by the quantum confinement effect, stronger interaction with light, etc.) can be exploited to fabricate novel types of high-efficiency solar cells. Here, again, silicon along with carbon and germanium (group IV elements) is about to play a major role.</p><p>In view of the increasing research effort devoted to nanostructures’ applications in PV, this book aims to provide a background to students and newcomer researchers as well as to point out some open questions and promising directions for future development. It presents a useful overview of group IV nanostructures for PV, which includes the theoretical background, presentation of main solar cell principles, technological aspects, and nanostructure characterization techniques, and finishes with the design and testing of prototype devices. It is not intended to be just a review of the most up-to-date literature, but the authors aim to provide an educative background of the field. All authors are renowned researchers and experienced teachers in the field of semiconductor nanostructures and photovoltaics.</p></span></span>",

It then discusses the optical and luminescence processes occurring in optically active centers of solid materials and presents the photoluminescence properties of traditional phosphors for white LEDs, including garnets, aluminates, silicates, sulfides, oxysulfides, phosphates, and scheelites.</p><p/><p>The remainder of the text focuses on newly developed nitride phosphors. The authors describe the crystal chemistry of general nitride compounds, the crystal structure and photoluminescence properties of new nitride phosphors, and synthetic methods for preparing nitride phosphors. They detail the structural analysis of nitride phosphors and present experimental and computational results of typical nitride phosphors. The authors also examine key issues, such as excitation and emission spectra, thermal quenching, and quantum efficiency. The final chapter explores applications of nitride phosphors in white LEDs for general lighting and LCD backlight purposes.</p><p/><p>Covering novel luminescent materials, this book brings you up to date on the evolving field of solid-state lighting.

The \"smart home\" market will reach well over $100 billion in the next five years on the promise of products that are truly integrated with our cooking, cleaning, entertainment, security, and hygiene habits.</p><p>But the reality is, these first-generation \"smart\" products aren't very smart—yet. We're clearly seeing only the tip of the iceberg in terms of capability and how such products can enhance our lives. How do we take it to the next level?</p><p>In a word, design—and more specifically, <i>social design</i>. In this fascinating and instructive book, leading product design expert Carla Diana describes how new technology is allowing designers to humanize consumer products in delightfully subtle ways. Showcasing vivid examples of social design principles such as \"product presence,\" \"object expression,\" and \"interaction intelligence,\" we see how inventive uses of light, sound, and movement can evoke human responses to even the most mundane products. Diana offers clear guidelines and takeaways for conceptualizing, building, and optimizing products using such methods as bodystorming, scenario storyboarding, video prototyping, behavior charting, and more.</p><p><i>My Robot Gets Me</i> provides keen insights and practical advice to anyone interested or involved in the burgeoning smart marketplace, from product designers and developers to managers and venture capitalists.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The future of manufacturing will be self-assembling products. It is said that life is nanotechnology that works—matter assemblers that are not theoretical. Long before industrial revolution, the assembly line, and mass-manufacturing, there were living systems. They successfully populated every energetic niche on the planet with products so technologically advanced and complex that to this day many attribute their design and manufacture to deities. In practical terms, these biological machines are made from non-toxic, commonly available precursors, do not require extreme temperatures or pressures, and are infinitely renewable—characteristics that we will need to apply to the manufacturing of more and more products if humanity is ever to achieve true sustainability. Science has been systematically deciphering the mechanisms of life for centuries, a process of reverse engineering that has been accelerating alongside our ability to manipulate at the micro- and nano-scale. Now, with many of the fundamental systems understood, and the conserved programming language of DNA deciphered, the ability to directly and reliably engineer biological systems and products is coming online. While it is still early days, biocoding and biomanufacturing looks to be one of the most powerful and compelling tools we've ever had to address global needs and challenges, one that will touch virtually every facet of human activity and enterprise. The Autodesk Bio/Nano Programmable Matter group is developing design tools for this space and integrating them with other domains and scales of computer-aided design and manufacturing.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>The discussion about energy perspectives beyond 2020, up to 2030 and eventually 2050 has started. There seems to be a verbal consensus on the necessity of ambitious climate change mitigation policies, without a convincing perspective of the necessary policy decisions to be reached in due time. Methods to achieve greenhouse gas reduction as well as energy security vary from aiming for 100% renewable energies and setting up appropriate policy frameworks to implementing a mix of renewables comprising so-called clean fossil and nuclear energy. This book provides an analysis of the different approaches and the reasons why there is no sustainable alternative to aiming for 100% renewables – and how this vision could come true. The book provides an overview and in-depth analysis of a vital debate. It describes how the present policy framework with 2020-targets for the share of renewables, for increase of energy efficiency and for greenhouse gas emissions reduction was developed and how it has been implemented so far. Furthermore, it describes and analyses the emerging debate about the future of our energy system and the necessary next steps and targets leading up to 2030. </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>A comprehensive guide to giving well to family members</b></p><p>Giving is at the core of family life--and with current law allowing up to $5,120,000 in tax-free gifts, at least through December 2012, the ultra-affluent are faced with the task of giving at perhaps largest scale in history. Beyond the tax saving and wealth management implications, giving to family members opens up a slew of thorny questions, the biggest of which is, \"How do I prepare recipients of such large gifts?\" With that question and others in mind, Hughes, Massenzio, and Whitaker have written The Cycle of the Gift in three main parts: \"The Who of Giving,\" \"The How of Giving,\" and \"The What and Why of Giving.\" The first part focuses on the people most deeply involved in family giving, especially the recipients and givers (parents, grandparents, spouses, trustees). The second part, \"The How of Giving,\" addresses the delicate balance of givers who want to maintain some level of control and recipients who want some level of freedom in accepting and growing their gifts. The final part, \"The What and Why of Giving\" describes various types of gifts, from money to business interests to values and rituals. The authors also introduce their \"family bank\" concept as a model that combines loans, trusts, and outright gifts. It embodies a framework and set of practices for long-term family growth. Even families without great wealth--or those who have already made large gifts to their children and grandchilren--can benefit from the human wisdom and practical advice found in <em>The Cycle of the Gift</em>.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>A <i>Washington Post</i> Bestseller</b></p><p><b>Not all collaboration is smart. Make sure you do it right.</b></p><p/><p>Professional service firms face a serious challenge. Their clients increasingly need them to solve complex problems—everything from regulatory compliance to cybersecurity, the kinds of problems that only <i>teams</i> of multidisciplinary experts can tackle.</p><p>Yet most firms have carved up their highly specialized, professional experts into narrowly defined practice areas, and collaborating across these silos is often messy, risky, and expensive. Unless you know <i>why</i> you’re collaborating and <i>how</i> to do it effectively, it may not be smart at all. That’s especially true for partners who have built their reputations and client rosters independently, not by working with peers.</p><p>In <i>Smart Collaboration</i>, Heidi K. Gardner shows that firms earn higher margins, inspire greater client loyalty, attract and retain the best talent, and gain a competitive edge when specialists collaborate across functional boundaries. Gardner, a former McKinsey consultant and Harvard Business School professor now lecturing at Harvard Law School, has spent over a decade conducting in-depth studies of numerous global professional service firms. Her research with clients and the empirical results of her studies demonstrate clearly and convincingly that collaboration pays, for both professionals and their firms.</p><p>But Gardner also offers powerful prescriptions for how leaders can foster collaboration, move to higher-margin work, increase client satisfaction, improve lateral hiring, decrease enterprise risk, engage workers to contribute their utmost, break down silos, and boost their bottom line.</p><p>With case studies and real-world insights, <i>Smart Collaboration</i> delivers an authoritative case for the value of collaboration to today’s professionals, their firms, and their clients and shows you exactly how to achieve it.</p></span>",

Instead of slowly depositing layers of plastic, a 3D carver starts with a solid block of material and carves it away using a rotating metal bit. It's faster than 3D printing, offers a wider choice of materials, and creates durable, permanent parts that look great. This book covers the basics of designing and making things with a 3D carver, and gives you several projects you can build yourself including a guitar, clock, earrings, and even a skateboard.</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>This book invites the reader on a journey of discovery of service systems. From a Service-Dominant-Logic perspective, such systems are the building blocks of all economic activity, and innovation of new service systems holds the promise of a new industrial revolution. Users navigating web sites, customers interacting with intelligent mobile retail applications, patients interpreting advice from health-care professionals and other sources, students interacting with teachers and learning materials, city dwellers invoking smart service applications for transportation routing, and the unlimited variations of smart service systems that will be enabled by the Internet of Things and other technologies provide ample evidence of the need for service innovation. This book presents an overview of the foundational constructs of service science and models of co-creative systems, with the aim of enabling the reader to be a service innovator. The value proposition of this book is the opportunity to fill each reader's knowledge gaps and offer a comprehensive, coherent, and introductory overview of service system modeling.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span>\nThe main links with your PC and the outside world are the centronic port, used for connecting the printer, the RS232 port, used for the mouse, and the games port for a joystick. This book explores how these input/output (I/O) ports can be put to use through a range of other interfacing applications. This is especially useful for laptop and palmtop PCs which cannot be fitted with internal I/O cards. A novel approach is taken by this book, combining the hardware through which the ports can be explored, and the software programming needed to carry out a range of experiments.<br/><br/>Circuits are provided for simple testing tools, and three experimental boards - which can also be purchased ready-made.<br/><br/>A huge range of applications are considered, turning the PC into a flexible core of a variety of systems. External devices considered include opto-isolator drivers, power drivers, LED drivers, relay drivers, special driver ICs, and methods of driving opto-isolated zero-crossing solid state relays, stepper motors, sound generating devices and displays. Ways of gathering information from the outside world are given, as well as connection to digital devices, remote control and digital communication. <br/><br/>As well as teaching in this field, Pei An has written numerous articles for magazines such as Electronics World and Electronics Today International.<ul><li>A hands-on guide to exploring your PC's input/output ports</li><li>Covers the hardware and software aspects of interfacing</li><li>An exciting project-based approach to an important subject area</li></ul>\n</span>",

			"description": "<span><div><strong>Meeting the new standard for leadership.</strong><br/><br/><em>Higher Ambition</em> is required reading for every leader who refuses to compromise between people and performance. Choosing one or the other may have worked in the past, but it won’t work now. As global competition stiffens and businesses face increased public scrutiny and renewed government regulation, leaders must win on <em>all</em> fronts—with their people, their customers, their communities, and their shareholders. In short, they must deliver superior economic <em>and</em> social value. Brimming with powerful stories and thoughtful advice from CEOs themselves, <em>Higher Ambition</em> equips leaders with the practical insights they need to meet this new and higher standard. The authors, an international team of experts from leading business schools and consultancies, offer a unique view into the minds of some of the most successful and insightful leaders of our time: CEOs from vanguard companies around the world that have demonstrated the distinctive ability to do <em>good</em> while also doing <em>well</em>. These organizations are as diverse as Standard Chartered Bank, Infosys, Volvo, Cummins, IKEA, the Tata Group, and Campbell’s Soup. Readers will learn the principles and practices these pioneering leaders are using to:<br/><br/>•\tBuild enduring enterprises that simultaneously solve for people and profits<br/><br/>•\tForge winning strategies that leverage their companies’ unique cultural and human capabilities<br/><br/>•\tDramatically raise the aspirations and ambitions of their people<br/><br/>•\tEnergize and align their diverse global firms<br/><br/>•\tRelentlessly upgrade leadership capabilities throughout their organizations<br/><br/>Drawing on the author team’s extensive research and in-depth interviews with successful leaders from around the globe, this provocative new book is poised to become a management classic in the tradition of <em>In Search of Excellence</em> and <em>Built to Last</em>.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>It is commonly believed that the\ncomputer-based systems most organizations rely on to support their\nbusinesses are not very smart. Many of the business decisions these\ncompanies make tend to be hidden in systems that make poor\ndecisions, or don't make them at all. Further, most systems aren't\nconfigured to learn from the past and therefore struggle to keep up\nwith the pace of change. While many organizations believe the\nanswer is to implement newer, \"intelligent\" systems, the fact is\nthat much of today's existing technology has the potential to be\n\"smart enough\" to make a big difference to an organization's\nbusiness.</p><p>This digital Short Cut lays out a cry for\nsystems that are smart enough to help companies survive and thrive\nin the world as it is today. Showing how the neglect of operational\ndecisions prevents effective implementation of strategy and\ndescribing the characteristics of effective operational\ndecision-making, the Short Cut establishes the role of operational\ndecisions. The characteristics of the smart enough systems modern\nbusiness needs are explained, and the absolute requirement for a\nnew approach is outlined.</p><p>This Short Cut is a reproduction of the\n“Smart Enough Systems Manifesto” and “Why You\nNeed Smart Enough Systems” chapters from the book.</p><p>This Short Cut should be of interest to\nsoftware and business professionals. In particular, it will be of\nvalue to those managing information systems and application\ndevelopment projects in defining the goals they should have in\nbuilding better systems, and to business owners who are frustrated\nby their current systems but cannot articulate how or why to change\nthings.</p><p><b>Contents</b></p><p><b>The “Smart Enough Systems”\nManifesto</b></p><p>    Operational Decisions Are\nImportant</p><p>    Operational Decisions Can\nand Should Be Automated</p><p>    Taking Control of\nDecisions is Increasingly a Source of Competitive Advantage</p><p><b>The Need for Smart Enough Systems</b></p><p>    The Importance of\nOperational Decisions</p><p>   \n      Strategy Drives\nDecision-making</p><p>   \n      Strategy Is Not Static</p><p>   \n      Operational Decisions\nMatter</p><p>   \n      Operational Decisions Are Under\nPressure</p><p>    Operational\nDecision-Making as a Corporate Asset</p><p>   \n      Characteristics of Operational\nDecisions</p><p>   \n      Characteristics of Corporate\nAssets</p><p>    Introducing Smart Enough\nSystems</p><p>   \n      Characteristics of Smart Enough\nSystems</p><p>   \n      Current Approaches Fail</p><p>   \n      Decision Management Is\nRequired</p><p>    Introducing Smart Enough\nLogistics</p></span></span>",
