			"description": "<span><div><p>Cyber attacks are no longer the domain of petty criminals. Today, companies find themselves targeted by sophisticated nation state attackers armed with the resources to craft scarily effective campaigns. This book is a detailed guide to understanding the major players in these cyber wars, the techniques they use, and the process of analyzing their advanced attacks. Whether you’re an individual researcher or part of a team within a Security Operations Center (SoC), you’ll learn to approach, track, and attribute attacks to these advanced actors.</p><p>The first part of the book is an overview of actual cyber attacks conducted by nation-state actors and other advanced organizations. It explores the geopolitical context in which the attacks took place, the patterns found in the attackers’ techniques, and the supporting evidence analysts used to attribute such attacks. Dive into the mechanisms of:</p><p>•North Korea’s series of cyber attacks against financial institutions, which resulted in billions of dollars stolen<br/>•The world of targeted ransomware attacks, which have leveraged nation state tactics to cripple entire corporate enterprises with ransomware<br/>•Recent cyber attacks aimed at disrupting or influencing national elections globally</p><p>The book’s second part walks through how defenders can track and attribute future attacks. You’ll be provided with the tools, methods, and analytical guidance required to dissect and research each stage of an attack campaign. Here, Jon DiMaggio demonstrates some of the real techniques he has employed to uncover crucial information about the 2021 Colonial Pipeline attacks, among many other advanced threats. He now offers his experience to train the next generation of expert analysts.</p></div></span>",

This means understanding their security is critical. <i>The Hardware Hacking Handbook</i> takes you deep inside different types of embedded systems, revealing the designs, components, security limits, and reverse-engineering challenges you need to know for executing effective hardware attacks.</p><p>Written with wit and infused with hands-on lab experiments, this handbook puts you in the role of an attacker interested in breaking security to do good. Starting with a crash course on the architecture of embedded devices, threat modeling, and attack trees, you’ll go on to explore hardware interfaces, ports and communication protocols, electrical signaling, tips for analyzing firmware images, and more. Along the way, you’ll use a home testing lab to perform fault-injection, side-channel (SCA), and simple and differential power analysis (SPA/DPA) attacks on a variety of real devices, such as a crypto wallet. The authors also share insights into real-life attacks on embedded systems, including Sony’s PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, and Philips Hue lights, and provide an appendix of the equipment needed for your hardware hacking lab – like a multimeter and an oscilloscope – with options for every type of budget.</p><p>You’ll learn:</p><p>•How to model security threats, using attacker profiles, assets, objectives, and countermeasures<br/>•Electrical basics that will help you understand communication interfaces, signaling, and measurement<br/>•How to identify injection points for executing clock, voltage, electromagnetic, laser, and body-biasing fault attacks, as well as practical injection tips<br/>•How to use timing and power analysis attacks to extract passwords and cryptographic keys<br/>•Techniques for leveling up both simple and differential power analysis, from practical measurement tips to filtering, processing, and visualization</p><p>Whether you’re an industry engineer tasked with understanding these attacks, a student starting out in the field, or an electronics hobbyist curious about replicating existing work, <i>The Hardware Hacking Handbook</i> is an indispensable resource – one you’ll always want to have onhand.</p></div></span>",

An architectural guide is necessary if you want to traverse the spectrum of technologies needed to build a successful IoT system, whether that's a single device or millions of devices.</p><p>This book encompasses the entire spectrum of IoT solutions, from sensors to the cloud. We start by examining modern sensor systems and focus on their power and functionality. After that, we dive deep into communication theory, paying close attention to near-range PAN, including the new Bluetooth® 5.0 specification and mesh networks. Then, we explore IP-based communication in LAN and WAN, including 802.11ah, 5G LTE cellular, SigFox, and LoRaWAN. Next, we cover edge routing and gateways and their role in fog computing, as well as the messaging protocols of MQTT and CoAP.</p><p>With the data now in internet form, you'll get an understanding of cloud and fog architectures, including the OpenFog standards. We wrap up the analytics portion of the book with the application of statistical analysis, complex event processing, and deep learning models. Finally, we conclude by providing a holistic view of the IoT security stack and the anatomical details of IoT exploits while countering them with software defined perimeters and blockchains.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This hands-on guide combines theory and application to the Internet of Things. This book covers the entire architectural stack of components and engineering domains from sensors to power analysis, communication systems, information theory, networking and routing, data security, protocols, software stacks, cloud mechanics, and data analytics with deep learning.</p></span>",

We’ll begin with the specific vocabulary of MQTT and its working modes, followed by installing a Mosquitto MQTT broker. Then, you will use best practices to secure the MQTT Mosquitto broker to ensure that only authorized clients are able to publish and receive messages. Once you have secured the broker with the appropriate configuration, you will develop a solution that controls a drone with Python.</p><p>Further on, you will use Python on a Raspberry Pi 3 board to process commands and Python on Intel Boards (Joule, Edison and Galileo). You will then connect to the MQTT broker, subscribe to topics, send messages, and receive messages in Python. You will also develop a solution that interacts with sensors in Java by working with MQTT messages.</p><p>Moving forward, you will work with an asynchronous API with callbacks to make the sensors interact with MQTT messages. Following the same process, you will develop an iOS app with Swift 3, build a website that uses WebSockets to connect to the MQTT broker, and control home automation devices with HTML5, JavaScript code, Node.js and MQTT messages</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>This step-by-step guide describes the MQTT protocol for your IoT projects</p><p>Downloading the example code for this book.

It standardizes most layers of robotics functionality from device drivers to process control and message passing to software package management.</p><p>But apart from just plain functionality, ROS is a great platform to learn about robotics itself and to simulate, as well as actually build, your first robots. This does not mean that ROS is a platform for students and other beginners; on the contrary, ROS is used all over the robotics industry to implement flying, walking and diving robots, yet implementation is always straightforward, and never dependent on the hardware itself.</p><p>ROS Robotics has been the standard introduction to ROS for potential professionals and hobbyists alike since the original edition came out; the second edition adds a gradual introduction to all the goodness available with the Kinetic Kame release.</p><p>By providing you with step-by-step examples including manipulator arms and flying robots, the authors introduce you to the new features. The book is intensely practical, with space given to theory only when absolutely necessary. By the end of this book, you will have hands-on experience on controlling robots with the best possible framework.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>ROS Robotics By Example, Second Edition gives the robotics beginner as well as the ROS newbie an immensely practical introduction to robot building and robotics application coding. ROS translates as \"robot operating system\"; you will learn how to control a robot via devices and configuration files, but you will also learn how to write robot applications on the foundation of this operating system.</p></span>",

The book is split into three parts. First, it introduces the Cortex-M33 and its architectural design and major processor peripherals. Second, it shows how to design secure software and secure communications to minimize the threat of both hardware and software hacking. And finally, it examines common IoT cloud systems and how to design and deploy a fleet of IoT devices. Example projects are provided for the Keil MDK-ARM and NXP LPCXpresso tool chains. </p><p>Since their inception, microcontrollers have been designed as functional devices with a CPU, memory and peripherals that can be programmed to accomplish a huge range of tasks. With the growth of internet connected devices and the Internet of Things (IoT), “plain old microcontrollers are no longer suitable as they lack the features necessary to create both a secure and functional device.

			"title": "Gamify: How Gamification Motivates People to Do Extraordinary Things",
			"description": "<span><p>Organizations are facing an engagement crisis. Regardless if they are customers, employees, patients, students, citizens, stakeholders, organizations struggle to meaningfully engage their key constituent groups who have a precious and limited resource: their time. Not surprisingly, these stakeholders have developed deflector shields to protect themselves. Only a privileged few organizations are allowed to penetrate the shield, and even less will meaningfully engage. To penetrate the shield, and engage the audience, organizations need an edge.<br/><br/> Gamification has emerged as a way to gain that edge and organizations are beginning to see it as a key tool in their digital engagement strategy. While gamification has tremendous potential to break through, most companies will get it wrong. Gartner predicts that by 2014, 80% of current gamified applications will fail to meet business objectives primarily due to poor design. As a trend, gamification is at the peak of the hype cycle; it has been oversold and it is broadly misunderstood. We are heading for the inevitable fall. Too many organizations have been led to believe that gamification is a magic elixir for indoctrinating the masses and manipulating them to do their bidding. These organizations are mistaking people for puppets, and these transparently cynical efforts are doomed to fail.<br/><br/> This book goes beyond the hype and focuses on the 20% that are getting it right. We have spoken to hundreds of leaders in organizations around the world about their gamification strategies and we have seen some spectacular successes. The book examines some of these successes and identifies the common characteristics of these initiatives to define the solution space for success. It is a guide written for leaders of gamification initiatives to help them avoid the pitfalls and employ the best practices, to ensure they join the 20% that gets it right.<br/><br/> Gamify shows gamification in action: as a powerful approach to engaging and motivating people to achieving their goals, while at the same time achieving organizational objectives. It can be used to motivate people to change behaviors, develop skills, and drive innovation. The sweet spot for gamification objectives is the space where the business objectives and player objectives are aligned. Like two sides of the same coin, player and business goals may outwardly appear different, but they are often the same thing, expressed different ways. The key to gamification success is to engage people on an emotional level and motivating them to achieve their goals.</p></span>",

The reader will learn how these circuits work and also how to build them, allowing them to progress to more advanced audio circuits in the future. Beginning with electrical fundamentals and control systems, DC circuit theory is then combined with an introduction to C programming to build Arduino-based systems for audio (tone sequencer) and MIDI (drum controller) output. The second half of the book begins with AC circuit theory to allow analogue audio circuits for amplification and filtering to be analysed, simulated, and built. These circuits are then combined with Arduino control in the final project – an Arduino-controlled two-band equalizer amplifier. </p><p>Building on high-school physics and mathematics in an accessible way, <i>Learn Audio Electronics with Arduino</i> is suitable for readers of all levels. An ideal tool for those studying audio electronics, including as a component within other fields of study, such as computer science, human-computer interaction, acoustics, music technology, and electronics engineering. </p></span>",

Readers will be introduced to basic electronics theory and programming concepts, as well as to digital and analog inputs and outputs. Throughout the book, debugging practices are highlighted, so novices will know what to do if their circuits or their code doesn't work for the current project and those that they embark on later for themselves. After completing the projects in this book, readers will have a firm basis for building their own projects with the Arduino.<br/><br/></p><li>Written for absolute beginners with no prior knowledge of electronics or programming</li><li>Filled with detailed full-color illustrations that make concepts and procedures easy to follow</li><li>An accessible introduction to microcontrollers and physical computing</li><li>Step-by-step instructions for projects that teach fundamental skills</li><li>Includes a variety of Arduino-based projects using digital and analog input and output</li></div></span>",

That includes kids, educators, parents, and anyone who didn't make it to engineering school. If you can cut, fold, and tape a piece of paper to make a tube or a box, you can build a no-tech robotic part. In fact, many of the models in this book are based upon real-life prototypes -- working models created in research labs and companies. What's more, if you can use the apps on your smartphone, you can quickly learn to tell robots what to do using free, online, beginner-level software like MIT's Scratch and Microsoft MakeCode.</p><p>The projects in this book which teach you about electric circuits by making jumping origami frogs with eyes that light up when you get them ready to hop. You'll practice designing all-terrain robot wheel-legs with free, online Tinkercad software, and you'll create files ready for 3D printing. You'll also learn to sew -- and code -- a cyborg rag doll with a blinking electronic \"eye.\"</p><p>Each project includes step-by-step directions and clear illustrations and photographs. Along the way, you'll learn about the real research behind the DIY version, find shortcuts for making projects easier when needed, and get suggestions for adding to the challenge as your skill set grows.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Compile and run Bitcoin full nodes, lightning nodes, and user-friendly web-apps that help abstract the complexities of Bitcoin. This book not only explains the tools and techniques to help readers build their own banks and banking apps, but it also tells a story. Starting with the origins of Bitcoin—what it is and why we need it—find out what its strengths and limitations are. Understand the nature of mining and why so much energy is put into it.  The blockchain itself will be reviewed, as well, and compared to other options such as a normal SQL database or a simple spreadsheet.</p><p>With this book, you can control Bitcoin wallets via RPC commands on a Raspberry Pi. Configure, compile, and run two implementation of the Lightning Network-compatible daemons: LND and c-lightning. And employ user-friendly web apps that abstract the complexities of Bitcoin/Lightning-Network.</p><p>The Internet of Information is currently transitioning to the Internet of Things, which in turn may well  be followed by the Internet of Value (or Money). However, there is no evolution without happy users and Bitcoin will never reach the same heights like the original internet without having offered “useful” and “easy to use” tools. Just like nobody would ever want to use UUCP to send messages via web the same applies to current cryptocurrency tools. These are hard to use and very unforgiving. But, the evolution doesn’t stop here and many easy-to-use tools are already available. We will meet some of them when building apps for the Lightning Network, a new technology running on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain that makes it possible to generate billions of transactions within a single second.  </p><div><b>What You'll Learn</b><br/></div><div><ul><li>Control Bitcoin wallets via console RPC commands<br/></li><li>Run two implementation of the Lightning Network compatible daemons<br/></li><li>Simplify the complexities of Bitcoin and the Lightning network with user-friendly web apps<br/></li></ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b><br/></div><div>This book is for Makers familiar with the basics of Linux command line processes.</div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><br/>      The emergence of a true systemic science - the systemic one - capable of rigorously addressing the many problems posed by the design and management of the evolution of modern complex systems is therefore urgently needed if wants to be able to provide satisfactory answers to the many profoundly systemic challenges that humanity will have to face at the dawn of the third millennium. This emergence is of course not easy because one can easily understand that the development of the systemic is mechanically confronted with all the classical disciplines which can all pretend to bring part of the explanations necessary to the understanding of a system and which do not naturally see a good eye a new discipline claim to encompass them in a holistic approach ... The book of Jacques Printz is therefore an extremely important contribution to this new emerging scientific and technical discipline: it is indeed first of all one of the very few \"serious\" works published in French and offering a good introduction to the systemic. It gives an extremely broad vision of this field, taking a thread given by the architecture of systems, in other words by the part of the systemic that is interested in the structure of systems and their design processes, which allows everyone to fully understand the issues and issues of the systemic. We can only encourage the reader to draw all the quintessence of the masterful work of Jacques Printz which mixes historical reminders explaining how the systemic emerged, introduction to key concepts of the systemic and practical examples to understand the nature and the scope of the ideas introduced.<br/>   </p></span>",

			"title": "IoT Development for ESP32 and ESP8266 with JavaScript: A Practical Guide to XS and the Moddable SDK",
			"description": "<span><p></p><p>This book introduces a new approach to embedded development, grounded in modern, industry-standard JavaScript. Using the same language that powers web browsers and Node.js, the Moddable SDK empowers IoT developers to apply many of the same tools and techniques used to build sophisticated websites and mobile apps.</p>\n\nThe Moddable SDK enables you to unlock the full potential of inexpensive microcontrollers like the ESP32 and ESP8266. Coding for these microcontrollers in C or C++ with the ESP-IDF and Arduino SDKs works for building basic products but doesn't scale to handle the increasingly complex IoT products that customers expect. The Moddable SDK adds the lightweight XS JavaScript engine to those traditional environments, accelerating development with JavaScript while keeping the performance benefits of a native SDK.<p></p>\n<p>Building user interfaces and communicating over the network are two areas where JavaScript really shines. <em>IoT Development for ESP32 and ESP8266 with JavaScript</em> shows you how to build responsive touch screen user interfaces using the Piu framework. You'll learn how easy it is to securely send and receive JSON data over Wi-Fi with elegant JavaScript APIs for common IoT protocols, including HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, MQTT, and mDNS. You'll also learn how to integrate common sensors and actuators, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), file systems, and more into your projects, and you'll see firsthand how JavaScript makes it easier to combine these diverse technologies.</p>\n\nIf you're an embedded C or C++ developer who has never worked in JavaScript, don't worry. This book includes an introduction to the JavaScript language just for embedded developers experienced with C or C++.<p></p>\n<p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong></p>\n<ul><ul><li>Building, installing,       and debugging JavaScript projects on the ESP32 and ESP8266</li><li>Using modern JavaScript       for all aspects of embedded development with the Moddable SDK</li><li>Developing IoT products       with animated user interfaces, touch input, networking, BLE, sensors,       actuators, and more</li></ul></ul> <p><strong>Who This Book Is For</strong></p>\n<ul><ul><li>Professional embedded       developers who want the speed, flexibility, and power of web development       in their embedded software work</li><li>Makers who want a       faster, easier way to build their hobby projects</li><li>Web developers working       in JavaScript who want to extend their skills to hardware products</li></ul></ul> <p> </p><br/><p></p></span>",

Semiotic theory can, however, appear mysterious and impenetrable. This introductory book decodes that mystery using visual examples instead of abstract theory. <br/><br/> This new edition features an expanded introduction that carefully and clearly presents the world of semiotics before leading into the book's 76 sections of key semiotic concepts. Each short section begins with a single image or sign, accompanied by a question inviting us to interpret what we are seeing. Turning the page, we can compare our response with the theory behind the sign, and in this way, actively engage in creative thinking. <br/><br/> A fascinating read, this book provides practical examples of how meaning is made in contemporary culture. </p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p><b>3 remarkable books reveal what\nneuroscientists have just learned about your brain — and\n<em>you!</em></b></p><p>Neuroscientists have made absolutely\nstunning discoveries about the brain: discoveries that are\nintimately linked to everything from your health and happiness to\nthe age-old debate on free will. In these three extraordinary\nbooks, leading scientists and science journalists illuminate these\ndiscoveries, helping you understand what they may mean — and\nwhat may come next. In <em>Brains: How They Seem to Work,</em> Dale\nPurves reviews the current state of neuroscientific research,\npreviewing a coming paradigm shift that may transform the way\nscientists think about brains yet again. Building on new research\non visual perception, he shows why common ideas about brain\nnetworks can’t be right, uncovers the factors that determine\nour subjective experience, sheds new light on the so-called\n“ghost in the machine,” and points towards a far deeper\nunderstanding of what it means to be human. Next, in <em>Pictures of\nthe Mind</em>, Miriam Boleyn-Fitzgerald uses images from the latest\nfMRI and PET scanners to illuminate science’s new\nunderstanding of the brain as amazingly flexible, resilient, and\nplastic. Through masterfully written narrative and stunning\nimagery, you'll watch human brains healing, growing, and\nadapting… gain powerful new insights into the interplay\nbetween environment and genetics… begin understanding how\npeople can influence their own intellectual abilities and emotional\nmakeup… and join scientists in tantalizing discoveries about\neverything from coma to PTSD and Alzheimer’s. Finally, in\n<em>The Root of Thought</em>, Andrew Koob shows why glial cells\n— once thought to be merely “brain glue” —\nmay actually hold the key to understanding intelligence, treating\npsychiatric disorders and brain injuries, and perhaps even curing\nAlzheimer's and Parkinson's. You'll learn how these crucial cells\ngrow and develop... why almost all brain tumors are comprised of\nthem… and even their apparent role in your every thought and\ndream!</p><p><em>From world-renowned scientists and\nscience journalists, including</em><b>Dale Purves, Miriam\nBoleyn-Fitzgerald,</b> and <b>Andrew Koob</b></p></span></span>",

			"title": "Linux for Makers, 1st Edition",
			"description": "<span><span><div><p>Linux is a powerful open-source operating system that has been around for many years and is widely used for running servers and websites. But most students and Makers encounter it for the first time when they are working on projects with their Raspberry Pi or similar single-board computers (SBCs) such as BeagleBone Black or Intel Galileo. Linux for Makers is the first book that explains the Linux operating system specifically for Makers, as opposed to programmers and administrators.  By gaining a deeper understanding of Linux, Makers can add another useful tool to their kit that will help them build their projects more easily.</p><p>Written with the Maker in mind, this book will focus mostly on Rasbian running on the Raspberry Pi as it is the most prolific in the ecosystem today. However most of the topics covered will apply broadly to other Linux distributions and will be called out when they may differ. Many times users cut and paste from a website tutorial into the Linux command line without understanding what they are actually doing only to be frustrated when they want to modify or tweak something to suit their needs. Also, many Makers shy away from using the Raspberry Pi or similar board because they feel Linux is too foreign and they think using a command line will be more difficult than using a GUI. This book aims to overcome those fears and provide a foundation for further learning and exploration. To that end, this book will focus on the basic principles that a Maker would need to know as opposed to other resources that go into detail that is not particularly relevant to building projects.</p></div></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p>Implement Arduino-based designs in your project, and build, debug, and extend it using a solid engineering approach. This second edition is expanded to provide a better understanding of the engineering process and what it means to be an end-to-end developer. </p><p> </p><p>You’ll start out by reviewing basic engineering procedures, from the fundamental requirements and preliminary design to prototyping and testing. You’ll then apply those principles to single devices like LCDs, potentiometers and GPS modules, and move on to the integration of several modules into a larger project, a sub-autonomous robot. This robot will include devices such as GPS, Bluetooth, an OLED screen, an accelerometer, humidity and temp sensor, motor drivers, and ultrasonic sensor.</p><p> </p><p>This version goes on to cover how to create 3D models with Fusion360, make your own PCBs using Eagle, and use and maintain a 3D printer. Each and every chapter exemplifies this process and demonstrates how you can profit from the implementation of solid engineering principles—regardless of whether you just play in your basement or you want to publicize and sell your devices. With <i>Practical Adruino Engineering</i> you’ll be able to review and improve this process, and even extend its scope. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>What You’ll Learn</p><p>●        Set up the Arduino software landscape and project for testing</p><p>●        Review the process of hardware engineering as applicable to Arduino projects </p>\n\n●        Create 3D models for 3D printing using Fusion360 in a robot chassis project<p></p>\n<p>●        Make PCBs using Eagle and incorporate it into a sensor station shield project</p>\n<p>●        Use and maintain a 3D printer with your own project </p>\n<p>●        Create Arduino shields in Eagle </p>\n<p>●        Debug Arduino projects of varying complexities via LabVIEW</p>\n<p>●        Use a special Arduino board for Bluetooth to control domestic and mobile Arduino projects </p>\n<p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>\n<p><b> </b></p>\n\nPrimarily aimed at intermediate engineers or engineering students.

Can you push it to operate at the level of a $2,000 computer? This book is here to help you find out.<div><br/></div><div>The primary focus of this book is getting as much as possible done with a simple Pi through non-graphic, non-mouse means. This means the keyboard and the text-mode screen. On the desktop side, you'll look at many of the most powerful GUI apps available, as these offer an easy entry to get started as you learn the command line.<br/><div><br/></div><div>You'll begin by setting up and configuring a Raspberry Pi with the option to run it as a graphical desktop environment or even more economically boot straight to the command line. If you want more performance, more efficiency, and (arguably) less complexity from your Pi that can only be found through the keyboard and command line. </div><div><br/></div><div>You'll also set up and configure a Raspberry Pi to use command line tools from within either the Raspberry Pi terminal, or by logging in remotely through some other computer. Once in, you'll look at Package Managers, Tmux, Ranger, and Midnight Commander as general-purpose power tools. The book then gets into specific task-oriented tools for reading email, spreadsheet work, notes, security, web browsing and design, social media, task and video password management, coding, and much more. There are conceptual overviews of Markdown, LaTeX, and Vim for work.</div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b></div><div><ul><li>Set up a Raspberry Pi system to get real work done using only the command line<br/></li><li>Login to a Pi remotely to use it as a remote server <br/></li><li>Integrate desktop Linux with command line mastery to optimize a Pi <br/></li><li>Work with tools for audio, writing news and weather, books, and graphics.<br/></li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>Those with minimal technical skills or hobbyists who are interested in “retro computing” or “minimalist” approaches. <br/></div></div></span>",

Here you’ll install the software needed for Python programming on the Pi, and then review the various data types and modules available. The next steps are to set up your Pis for gathering real-time data and incorporate the basic operations of data science related to real-time applications. You’ll then combine all these new skills to work with machine learning concepts that will enable your Raspberry Pi to learn from the data it gathers. Case studies round out the book to give you an idea of the range of domains where these concepts can be applied. </p><p>By the end of Data Science with the Raspberry Pi, you’ll understand that many applications are now dependent upon cloud computing. As Raspberry Pis are cheap, it is easy to use a number of them closer to the sensors gathering the data and restrict the analytics closer to the edge. You’ll find that not only is the Pi an easy entry point to data science, it also provides an elegant solution to cloud computing limitations through localized deployment.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><li>Interface the Raspberry Pi      with sensors</li><li>Set up the Raspberry Pi as a      localized cloud</li>  Tackle data science concepts      with Python on the Pi  <p><b>Who This Book Is For</b></p>\n<p>Data scientists who are looking to implement real-time applications using the Raspberry Pi as an edge device and localized cloud.

The economic model promoted by the behavior economy is a model where behavior is the only goal of our actions, and where intrinsic motivation is the key to participation, engagement, and the satisfaction of multiple dimensions of value.   Value Creation and the Internet of Things describes value delivery and consumption, and the mechanisms by which new value is captured and created, in enterprises dedicated to competing and prospering in this new environment.   This book is significant in the context of the Internet of Things becoming mainstream, forcing organizations to re-examine their value creation methodologies in light of new consumer behavior and expectations. The Internet of Things will reframe the existence of the ones enriched by it. It will do so not because it can, but because our motivation will demand it. This is a book about reframing reality for new and incumbent organizations. The reality to reframe is not an imaginary one, but the immediate reality in which one operates: the behavior economy.<br></p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><i>PID Control with Intelligent Compensation for Exoskeleton Robots</i> explains how to use neural PD and PID controls to reduce integration gain, and provides explicit conditions on how to select linear PID gains using proof of semi-global asymptotic stability and local asymptotic stability with a velocity observer. These conditions are applied in both task and joint spaces, with PID controllers compensated by neural networks. This is a great resource on how to combine traditional PD/PID control techniques with intelligent control. Dr. Wen Yu presents several leading-edge methods for designing neural and fuzzy compensators with high-gain velocity observers for PD control using Lyapunov stability. </p><p>Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control is widely used in biomedical and industrial robot manipulators. An integrator in a PID controller reduces the bandwidth of the closed-loop system, leads to less-effective transient performance and may even destroy stability. Many robotic manipulators use proportional-derivative (PD) control with gravity and friction compensations, but improved gravity and friction models are needed. The introduction of intelligent control in these systems has dramatically changed the face of biomedical and industrial control engineering. </p><ul><li>Discusses novel PD and PID controllers for biomedical and industrial robotic applications, demonstrating how PD and PID with intelligent compensation is more effective than other model-based compensations </li><li>Presents a stability analysis of the book for industrial linear PID </li><li>Includes practical applications of robotic PD/PID control, such as serial sliding mode, explicit conditions for linear PID and high gain observers for neural PD control </li><li>Includes applied exoskeleton applications and MATLAB code for simulations and applications</li></ul></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>In today's turbulent technological environment, it's becoming increasingly crucial for companies to know about the principle of least privilege. These organizations often have the best security software money can buy, with equally developed policies with which to execute them, but they fail to take into account the weakest link in their implementation: human nature. Despite all other efforts, people can sway from what they should be doing.</p><p><em>Preventing Good People from doing Bad Things</em> drives that concept home to business executives, auditors, and IT professionals alike. Instead of going through the step-by-step process of implementation, the book points out the implications of allowing users to run with unlimited administrator rights, discusses the technology and supplementation of Microsoft's Group Policy, and dives into the different environments least privilege affects, such as Unix and Linux servers, and databases.</p><p>Readers will learn ways to protect virtual environments, how to secure multi-tenancy for the cloud, information about least privilege for applications, and how compliance enters the picture. The book also discusses the cost advantages of preventing good people from doing bad things. Each of the chapters emphasizes the need auditors, business executives, and IT professionals all have for least privilege, and discuss in detail the tensions and solutions it takes to implement this principle. Each chapter includes data from technology analysts including Forrester, Gartner, IDC, and Burton, along with analyst and industry expert quotations.</p><ul><li><p>Why unlimited administration rights are a bad thing</p></li><li><p>Why least privileges is a good solution</p></li><li><p>Effective implementation of least privileges</p></li><li><p>Least privileges on Unix and Linux servers</p></li><li><p>Issues with Microsoft's Group Policy</p></li></ul><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>The audience is segmented into three separate categories, all of which are clearly addressed and weighed-in on in each chapter: the auditor, the businessman, and the IT professional.</p><p><b>Auditor</b></p><p>The first segment are the information technology security auditors. They are the ones responsible for the analysis of technical, physical, and administrative controls in the organization(s) whose security is in question. Their work includes the auditing of data center personnel, computer equipment, all policies and procedures, physical and environmental controls, and back-up procedures. Because their jobs so heavily rely on established protocols for the protection of sensitive information, this segment of the market will find this book a must-read. Their main concern is making sure the companies they are inspecting are in compliance with regulations and are taking the appropriate measures to secure their information and the users accessing them. They will learn how least privilege is the only way to fully satisfy government security regulations, and it will give them necessary and cutting-edge information on how to correctly perform their jobs.</p><p><b>Businessperson</b></p><p>The second segment are the businesspeople. They are the ones who run the companies requiring least privilege. These individuals are driven by the bottom line, and are ultimately concerned with spending and returns on investment. While they may be interested in security and realize its importance, the motivation behind any decisions is saving the company money. They need this book because it will clearly outline the financial benefits of implementing least privilege. It will explain that, from a business point of view, least privilege is the only way to eliminate the misuse of privilege and avoid the extensive costs of security breaches, expensive audits, help desk costs, and costly hours of IT troubleshooting. They will read it and use it as a reference as they prepare financially for a more secure IT environment.</p><p><b>IT Professional</b></p><p>The third and final segment are the IT professionals. They are the ones who appreciate security for security's sake. They understand the implications of a noncompliant environment. They are on the forefront of the company's information environment. They manage users and those users' privileges. They download applications, grant privileges to users, process information, store information, program, install software, perform data management, network machines, and manage the networks they create. They need and will read this book because it will expand their understanding of the concept of least privilege and apply it to the environment in which they work. They will learn how to supplement Group Policy to attain least privilege, how to protect their environments, and how to carry security throughout their enterprise. This book will teach them new ways to look at the principle of least privilege, and it will educate them with the information necessary to receive executive and financial backing to the projects that will secure their network.</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><br/>      Localization for underwater robots remains a challenging issue. Typical sensors, such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, cannot be used under the surface and other inertial systems suffer from a strong integration drift. On top of that, the seabed is generally uniform and unstructured, making it difficult to apply Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods to perform localization. Reliable Robot Localization presents an innovative new method which can be characterized as a raw-data SLAM approach. It differs from extant methods by considering time as a standard variable to be estimated, thus raising new opportunities for state estimation, so far underexploited. However, such temporal resolution is not straightforward and requires a set of theoretical tools in order to achieve the main purpose of localization. This book not only presents original contributions to the field of mobile robotics, it also offers new perspectives on constraint programming and set-membership approaches. It provides a reliable contractor programming framework in order to build solvers for dynamical systems. This set of tools is illustrated throughout this book with realistic robotic applications.<br/>   </p></span>",

This book assumes little experience or knowledge of the Internet of Things. To fully appreciate the book, limited programming background would be helpful for some of the chapters later in the book, though the basic content is explained. </p><p></p><p>The author, Alasdair Gilchrist, has spent 25 years as a company director in the fields of IT, Data Communications, Mobile Telecoms and latterly Cloud/SDN/NFV technologies, as a professional technician, support manager, network and security architect. He has project-managed both agile SDLC software development as well as technical network architecture design. He has experience in the deployment and integration of systems in enterprise, cloud, fixed/mobile telecoms, and service provider networks.

			"title": "Complex Behavior in Evolutionary Robotics",
			"description": "<span><p>Today, autonomous robots are used in a rather limited range of applications such as exploration of inaccessible locations, cleaning floors, mowing lawns etc. However, ongoing hardware improvements (and human fantasy) steadily reveal new robotic applications of significantly higher sophistication. For such applications, the crucial bottleneck in the engineering process tends to shift from physical boundaries to controller generation. As an attempt to automatize this process, Evolutionary Robotics has successfully been used to generate robotic controllers of various types. However, a major challenge of the field remains the evolution of truly complex behavior. Furthermore, automatically created controllers often lack analyzability which makes them useless for safety-critical applications. In this book, a simple controller model based on Finite State Machines is proposed which allows a straightforward analysis of evolved behaviors. To increase the model's evolvability, a procedure is introduced which, by adapting the genotype-phenotype mapping at runtime, efficiently traverses both the behavioral search space as well as (recursively) the search space of genotype-phenotype mappings. Furthermore, a data-driven mathematical framework is proposed which can be used to calculate the expected success of evolution in complex environments.</p></span>",

In this book, Shingo Prize-winning author Patrick Graupp collaborates with two practitioners who performed the planning and implementation of the LEGO Group‘s worldwide Learning Organization.<br/><br/>The book outlines the organizational and planning models used by the LEGO Group to create the internal ability to give and receive tacit skills and knowledge. Describing how and why TWI is used as the foundation for success in knowledge transfer across diverse languages and cultures, it provides step-by-step guidance on how to establish a solid organizational foundation for your own Learning Organization.<br/><br/>Providing expert insight into the work of culture change, the book explains how to work with people to create motivation for moving to a new system of learning. It details the critical elements that made the implementation at the LEGO Group a success, identifies the stumbling blocks they encountered along the way, and explains how they were overcome. Case studies describe in detail what these efforts looked and felt like in actual application.<br/><br/>The TWI program has long been recognized for its ability to generate results. After reading this book, you will gain valuable insight into how your organization whether large or small, national or international can integrate this timeless tool into your operating structure and your daily culture.</p></span>",

Once merely objects of play, today’s toys often act as <i>agents</i> of play, guiding kids toward learning through interactivity and feedback. As this O’Reilly report explains, smart toys not only employ sophisticated algorithms, but also share data and get updates via the cloud. What are the implications of a toy that, instead of fostering open-ended play, now becomes the playmate?</p><p>Author Meghan Athavale takes you on an objective tour of today’s smart toys: how they’ve evolved from their roots in the early ’90s, as well as the ethics, risks, and promise they carry with them. Though it’s still early days, digital toys are already changing how children learn and socialize. They’re also likely to have a permanent impact on our brains and our culture.</p><p>In this report, you’ll explore:</p><ul><li>Three feedback loops that guide the behavior of a smart toy over its lifetime</li><li>Privacy concerns about a smart toy’s ability to \"converse\" with children by collecting and storing conversations</li><li>The risk of children becoming socially withdrawn and addicted to technology due to increased use of smart toys</li><li>Benefits of smart toys, including the ability of the machines to learn from users and provide customized education</li><li>Predictions for how data and technology will change the nature of play and toys—including connected play and immersive environments</li></ul></div></span>",

This is the second book by Ahmed Bakir (author of <em>Beginning iOS Media App Development</em>) and his team at devAtelier LLC, who have been involved in developing over 20 mobile projects.</p><p>Written like a code review, this book presents a detailed \"\"how\"\" and \"\"why\"\" for each topic, explaining Apple-specific design patterns as they come up and pulling lessons from other popular apps. To help you getting up and running quickly, each chapter is framed within a working project, allowing you to use the sample code directly in your apps.</p><p>The Internet of Things is not limited to Apple devices alone, so this book also explains how to interface with popular third-party hardware devices, such as the Fitbit and Raspberry Pi, and generic interfaces, like Restful API’s and HTTPS. The Internet of Things is waiting — be a part of it!</p></span></span>",

Machine-to-machine communications, big data, cloud computing, distributed systems, networking, mobile and telco, apps, and smart devices all contribute to IoT capabilities. This O’Reilly report examines the critical role that operational databases play in that convergence.</p><p>IoT data management platforms need to handle data in motion (fast data) as well as data at rest (big data). Legacy data systems aren’t designed to manage vast inflows of high-velocity data from multiple devices and sources. But as VoltDB CTO Ryan Betts explains, operational databases have the performance and scalability to combine data from analytics run against collected (big) data with the current state and readings of things (fast).</p><p>This report explains how operational databases enable IoT applications to fulfill four data management capabilities:</p><ul><li>Fast Ingest: In-memory performance and horizontal scalability that provide a single ingestion point for high-velocity data feeds</li><li>Explore and Analyze: Real-time access to applications and querying engines</li><li>Act: The ability to trigger events and make decisions based on inbound streams</li><li>Export: The ability to export accumulated, filtered, enriched, or augmented data to downstream systems</li></ul><p>About the author</p><p>Ryan Betts, VoltDB CTO, is one of the company’s founding developers. He’s been designing and building distributed systems and high-performance infrastructure software for almost 20 years. Chances are, if you’ve used the Internet, some of your ones and zeros passed through a slice of code he wrote or tested.</p></div></span>",

			"title": "Sensing, Intelligence, Motion: How Robots and Humans Move in an Unstructured World",
			"description": "<span><span><p>A leap forward in the field of robotics</p><p>Until now, most of the advances in robotics have taken place in structured environments. Scientists and engineers have designed highly sophisticated robots, but most are still only able to operate and move in predetermined, planned environments designed specifically for the robots and typically at very high cost. This new book takes robotics to the next level by setting forth the theory and techniques needed to achieve robotic motion in unstructured environments. The ability to move and operate in an arbitrary, unplanned environment will lead to automating a wide range of new robotic tasks, such as patient care, toxic site cleanup, and planetary exploration.</p><p>The approach that opens the door for robots to handle unstructured tasks is known as Sensing-Intelligence-Motion (SIM), which draws from research in topology, computational complexity, control theory, and sensing hardware. Using SIM as an underlying foundation, the author's carefully structured presentation is designed to:</p><ul><li><p>Formulate the challenges of sensor-based motion planning and then build a theoretical foundation for sensor-based motion planning strategies</p></li><li><p>Investigate promising algorithmic strategies for mobile robots and robot arm manipulators, in both cases addressing motion planning for the whole robot body</p></li><li><p>Compare robot performance to human performance in sensor-based motion planning to gain better insight into the challenges of SIM and help build synergistic human-robot teams for tele-operation tasks. It is both exciting and encouraging to discover that robot performance decisively exceeds human performance in certain tasks requiring spatial reasoning, even when compared to trained operators</p></li><li><p>Review sensing hardware that is necessary to realize the SIM paradigm</p></li></ul><p>Some 200 illustrations, graphic sketches, and photos are included to clarify key issues, develop and validate motion planning approaches, and demonstrate full systems in operation.</p><p>As the first book fully devoted to robot motion planning in unstructured environments, Sensing, Intelligence, Motion is a must-read for engineers, scientists, and researchers involved in robotics. It will help them migrate robots from highly specialized applications in factories to widespread use in society where autonomous robot motion is needed.</p></span></span>",

By providing a myriad of libraries, the Arduino community has made it very easy to interact with pretty much any piece of hardware out there. XBee offers a great range of low-power wireless solutions that are easy to work with, by taking all of the complexity of wireless (mesh) networking out of your hands and letting you focus on what to send without worrying about the how. Building wireless sensor networks is cost-effective as well as efficient as it will be done with Arduino support.</p><p>The book starts with a brief introduction to various wireless protocols, concepts, and the XBee hardware that enables their use. Then the book expands to explain the Arduino boards to you, letting them read and send sensor data, collect that data centrally, and then even control your home from the Internet. Moving further more advanced topics such as interacting through the standard Zigbee Home Automation protocol, or making your application power-efficient are covered. By the end of the book, you will have all the tools needed to build complete, real-world solutions.</p><p><b>Style and approach</b></p><p>A hands-on guide, featuring a single home automation project that can be built as described or with endless variations. Every step is illustrated with complete examples and screenshots, allowing you to build the examples swiftly.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>The Internet of Things is the new generation of devices that serve as the Internet's interface to the physical world. Today's tiny microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators are powerful, inexpensive, and simple enough to code that anyone with basic programming skills can create a variety of fun, useful, and even profitable systems -- such as devices that detect and extinguish fires or automatically water plants when the soil becomes too dry. This hands-on introductory guide will quickly show you how it's done.</p><p/><p>You'll learn how to program embedded devices using the .NET Micro Framework and the Netduino Plus board, and then connect these devices to the Internet using Pachube, a cloud platform for sharing real-time sensor data. <em>Getting Started with the Internet of Things</em> briefly introduces the tools and then walks you though several techniques for using them, using a series of C# examples:</p><ul><li><p>Develop programs that demonstrate the use of simple outputs (actuators) and inputs (sensors)</p></li><li><p>Build client programs that show how measurements can be pushed to an existing Web service</p></li><li><p>Create server programs that provide Web services to clients on the Web</p></li><li><p>Develop a program that is both client and server and runs in the cloud</p></li><li><p>Get .NET classes and methods needed to implement all of the book's examples</p></li></ul><p>This book is still in progress, but you can get going on this amazing microcontroller technology through our Rough Cuts edition, which lets you read the manuscript <em>as it's being written</em>, either online or via PDF.

This O’Reilly report examines various features that heavy-equipment B2B industries should expect in an IoT platform, as well as the key attributes you should be looking for when choosing a platform vendor.</p><p>Up to this point, much of the effort in developing an IoT solution has gone into platform building. But if you are to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, you can’t afford to build technology stacks from scratch to accommodate hardware, firmware, software, edge computing, analytics, business systems integration, and many other components.</p><p>In this report, author Matthew Perry explains what an industrial-grade IoT platform ideally should include, from bidirectional connectivity and distributed computing to availability, scalability, and reliability. You’ll also learn how to assess your IoT strategy and find a vendor that can fulfill your specific needs.</p><p><i>Matthew J. Perry is a writer and editor with a particular interest in how the Internet of Things can make cities smarter. He has written for Cisco Systems and collaborated on ten published books.

			"description": "<span><span><span><p>Arduino boards have impressed both hackers and professional engineers. Whether you're a hobbyist or a professional, it isn't just a breadboard and a hazy idea that keeps you going. It's essential to institute a proper design, device instrumentation and, indeed, test your project thoroughly before committing to a particular prototype.</p><p><em>Practical Arduino Engineering</em> begins by outlining the engineering process, from the basic requirements and preliminary design to prototyping and testing. Each and every chapter exemplifies this process and demonstrates how you can profit from the implementation solid engineering principles—regardless of whether you just play in your basement or you want to publicize and sell your devices.</p><p>Arduino is a brilliant prototyping platform that allows users to test and iterate design ideas. Imitation by other Arduino makers, hackers and engineers often proves your design's popularity. <em>Practical Arduino Engineering</em> will teach you to follow the engineering process carefully; over time, you will be able to review and improve this process, and even extend its scope.</p><p><em>Practical Arduino Engineering</em> is not purely theoretical. In addition, you'll learn the process of hardware engineering as applicable to Arduino projects, and the importance of the process in each and every project presented in this book.</p><p>To set the stage, <em>Practical Arduino Engineering</em> begins by reviewing the Arduino software landscape, then shows how to set up an Arduino project for testing. Even if you already know your compiler toolchain and the basics of Arduino programming, this refresher course can help fill in the gaps and explain why your compiler may spit out certain error messages.</p><p><em>Practical Arduino Engineering</em> then gradually builds up the engineering process, from single devices like LCDs, potentiometers and GPS modules, to the integration of several modules into larger projects, such as a wireless temperature measurement system, and ultimately an entire robot.</p><p>The engineering projects become progressively more challenging throughout the first 4 engineering chapters. Next, you'll proceed with simple steps towards the first intelligent part of a robot: the object detector. You'll find yourself teaching your robot how to avoid very hot objects or insurmountable obstacles. The basic design requirements for a complete robot and, indeed, the detailed design and prototyping for robots can be extremely tricky, which is why engineering discipline is invaluable.</p><p><em>Practical Arduino Engineering</em> then enters the world of domestic engineering by introducing home alarm systems—not quite as simple as they seem. A solid, robust system can only be built by following the engineering process detailed in previous chapters, and this section reinforces that process.</p><p>You'll then take a step further in your Arduino engineering process: instrumentation and control, and some error messaging using GSM. Control is introduced via the Xbox controller, a very powerful piece of technology able to play a considerable role in robotics projects. Having already learned to control motion and to sense and avoid objects, you'll learn how to debug your Arduino projects of varying complexities via the hardware instrumentation software LabVIEW.</p><p>To complete the journey into <em>Practical Arduino Engineering</em>, you'll discover how to use a special Arduino board to rely on Bluetooth Mate Silver for control of domestic and mobile Arduino projects. Using Bluetooth Mate Silver, you'll learn to implement basic engineering design with almost any Arduino project, and be able to justify, build, debug, and extend Arduino-based designs using a solid engineering approach.</p></span></span></span>",

Bustling metropolises infused with the right combination of the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data, and blockchain promise to improve both our daily lives and larger structural operations at a city government level. The practical realities pose challenges that a significant sector of the tech industry now revolves around solving.</p><p>Cut through the hype with <i>Demystifying Smart Cities</i>. In this book, the real-world implementations of successful Smart City technology in places like New York, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and more are analyzed, and insights are gained from recorded attempts in similar urban centers that have not reached their full Smart City potential. From the logistical complications of securing thousands of devices to collect millions of pieces of data daily, to the complicated governmental processes that are required to install Smart City tech, <i>Demystifying Smart Cities </i>covers every aspect of this revolutionary modern technology.</p><p>This book is the essential guide for anybody who touches a step of the Smart City process—from salespeople representing product vendors to city government officials to data scientists—and provides a more well-rounded understanding of the full positive and negative impacts of Smart City technology deployment. <i>Demystifying Smart Cities</i> evaluates how our cities can behave in a more intelligent way, and how producing novel solutions can pose equally novel challenges. The future of the metropolis is here, and the expert knowledge in the book is your greatest asset.</p><div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b></div><div><div><ul><li>Practical issues and challenges of managing thousands and millions of IoT devices in a city<br/></li><li>The different types of city data and how to manage and secure it<br/></li><li>The possibilities of utilizing AI into a city (and how it differs from working with the private sector)<br/></li><li>Examples of how to make cities smarter with technology<br/></li></ul></div><div><br/></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><div>Primarily for those already familiar with the hype of smart city technologies but not the details of its implementation, along with technologists interested in learning how city government works when integrating technology.

This book is ideal for enthusiastic novice programmers, electronics hobbyists, and engineering professionals. It would be great if you have some basic soldering skills in order to build some of the interface modules.</p><p><b>What You Will Learn</b></p><ul><li>Understand the concepts behind alarm systems and intrusion detection devices</li><li>Connect sensors and devices to the on-board digital GPIO ports safely</li><li>Monitor and control connected devices easily using Bash shell scripting</li><li>Build an I/O port expander using the I2C bus and connect sensors and anti-tamper circuits</li><li>Capture and store images using motion detectors and cameras</li><li>Access and manage your system remotely from your mobile phone</li><li>Receive intrusion alerts and images through your e-mail</li><li>Build a sophisticated multi-zone alarm system</li></ul><p><b>In Detail</b></p><p>The Raspberry Pi is a powerful low-cost credit-card-sized computer, which lends itself perfectly as the controller for a sophisticated home security system. Using the on-board interfaces available, the Raspberry Pi can be expanded to allow the connection of a virtually infinite number of security sensors and devices. The Raspberry Pi has the processing power and interfaces available to build a sophisticated home security system but at a fraction of the cost of commercially available systems.</p><p>Building a Home Security System with Raspberry Pi starts off by showing you the Raspberry Pi and how to set up the Linux-based operating system. It then guides you through connecting switch sensors and LEDs to the native GPIO connector safely, and how to access them using simple Bash scripts. As you dive further in, you'll learn how to build an input/output expansion board using the I2C interface and power supply, allowing the connection of the large number of sensors needed for a typical home security setup.</p><p>In the later chapters of the book, we'll look at more sophisticated topics such as adding cameras, remotely accessing the system using your mobile phone, receiving intrusion alerts and images by e-mail, and more.</p><p>By the end of the book, you will be well-versed with the use of Raspberry Pi to power a home-based security system that sends message alerts whenever it is triggered and will be able to build a truly sophisticated and modular home security system. You will also gain a good understanding of Raspberry Pi's ecosystem and be able to write the functions required for a security system.</p><p><b>Style and approach </b></p><p>This easy-to-follow guide comprises a series of projects, where every chapter introduces a new concept and at the end of the book, all these concepts are brought together to create an entire home security system.

			"description": "<span><p>For all the interest that wireless sensor networks have created over the past decade, there are few examples to show that they are truly delivering on this promise and anticipation. What is missing? Deviating from the usual focus on routing and energy efficiency,<strong> Building Sensor Networks: From Design to Applications </strong>attempts to stitch together the path from conceptual development of applications, on one end, to actual complete applications at the other. With this change in perspective, the book examines important facets of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that are not often discussed in the literature.</p><p><strong><em>From Design Practices to the Networking Protocols that Glue Applications Together</em></strong></p><p>Organized into three sections, the book presents insights from international experts representing both industry and academia. The first section, on design practices, explores alternative ways to approach the tasks of developing a suitable WSN solution to an application and assisting that development in a manner that is not necessarily tied to a particular application. The second section, on networking protocols, illustrates the impact of the intermediaries—the \"glue\" of putting applications together. Chapters look at ways to address traffic, delays in network clustering, and the coexistence of a WSN with other systems on a frequency band. The final section of the book delves into experiences with applications in chemical sensing, defense, global trade and security, and ecosystem monitoring. Although these applications may fail the purist definition of an ideal WSN, they offer valuable lessons for the future development and deployment of WSNs.</p><p><strong><em>Challenge Your Thinking about Designing WSN Applications</em></strong></p><p>Emphasizing the need to build applications, the contributors present examples of what applications of WSNs could look like and identify the constraints. Throughout, the book challenges and illuminates your thinking about how to tame the complexity of designing a WSN application. It is essential reading for anyone interested in future wireless technologies.</p></span>",

			"title": "Robot Manipulator Redundancy Resolution",
			"description": "<span><p><b>Introduces a revolutionary, quadratic-programming based approach to </b><b>solving long-standing problems in motion planning and control of redundant manipulators</b> </p><p>This book describes a novel quadratic programming approach to solving redundancy resolutions problems with redundant manipulators. Known as ``QP-unified motion planning and control of redundant manipulators'' theory, it systematically solves difficult optimization problems of inequality-constrained motion planning and control of redundant manipulators that have plagued robotics engineers and systems designers for more than a quarter century.    </p><p>An example of redundancy resolution could involve a robotic limb with six joints, or degrees of freedom (DOFs), with which to position an object. As only five numbers are required to specify the position and orientation of the object, the robot can move with one remaining DOF through practically infinite poses while performing a specified task. In this case redundancy resolution refers to the process of choosing an optimal pose from among that infinite set. A critical issue in robotic systems control, the redundancy resolution problem has been widely studied for decades, and numerous solutions have been proposed. This book investigates various approaches to motion planning and control of redundant robot manipulators and describes the most successful strategy thus far developed for resolving redundancy resolution problems. </p><ul><li>Provides a fully connected, systematic, methodological, consecutive, and easy approach to solving redundancy resolution problems</li><li>Describes a new approach to the time-varying Jacobian matrix pseudoinversion, applied to the redundant-manipulator kinematic control</li><li>Introduces The QP-based unification of robots' redundancy resolution</li><li>Illustrates the effectiveness of the methods presented using a large number of computer simulation results based on PUMA560, PA10, and planar robot manipulators</li><li>Provides technical details for all schemes and solvers presented, for readers to adopt and customize them for specific industrial applications </li></ul><p><i>Robot Manipulator Redundancy Resolution</i> is must-reading for advanced undergraduates and graduate students of robotics, mechatronics, mechanical engineering, tracking control, neural dynamics/neural networks, numerical algorithms, computation and optimization, simulation and modelling, analog, and digital circuits. It is also a valuable working resource for practicing robotics engineers and systems designers and industrial researchers.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span>Microcomputer technology and micromechanical design have contributed to recent rapid advances in Robotics. Particular advances have been made in sensor technology that allow robotic systems to gather data and react \"intelligently\" in flexible manufacturing systems. The analysis and recording of the data are vital to controlling the robot.<br/>In order to solve problems in control and planning for a Robotic system it is necessary to meet the growing need for the integration of sensors in to the system. <b>Control in Robotics and Automation</b> addresses this need. This book covers integration planning and control based on prior knowledge and real-time sensory information. A new task-oriented approach to sensing, planning and control introduces an event-based method for system design together with task planning and three dimensional modeling in the execution of remote operations.<br/>Typical remote systems are teleoperated and provide work efficiencies that are on the order of ten times slower than what is directly achievable by humans. Consequently, the effective integration of automation into teleoperated remote systems offers potential to improve remote system work efficiency. The authors introduce visually guided control systems and study the role of computer vision in autonomously guiding a robot system.<br/><br/><br/>* Sensor-Based Planning and Control in an Event-Based Approach<br/>* Visually Guided Sensing and Control<br/>* Multiple Sensor Fuson in Planning and Control<br/>* System Integration and Implementation<br/>* Practical Applications</span>",

			"description": "<span><div><p>Ambitious plans are underway to create the Industrial Internet, but as this O'Reilly report explains, the attempt to marry the Internet with the world's industrial platforms faces significant challenges that resist easy solutions. This cyber-physical coupling is like trying to engineer a complex new life form, using pre-existing parts that weren't designed to work together.</p><p>But there is progress. Author Mike Barlow explores how groups such as the Industrial Internet Consortium and the Global City Teams Challenge are working to create a firm structure for the Industrial Internet that includes rules and principles, rather than repeating the serendipitous nature of the Internet.</p><p>The Industrial Internet isn't just another tech fad. It's the beginning of a new chapter in human history. Will it advance the dream of universal prosperity, or quickly mutate into a chaotic and dangerous \"Internet of unsafe things?\" Pick up this free report and learn how industrial groups are working to make this dream come true.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>The first book focusing on one of the hottest new topics in Internet of Things systems research and development</b></p><p>Studies estimate that by 2020 we will have a vast Internet of Things (IoT) network comprising 26 billion connected devices, including everything from light bulbs to refrigerators, coffee makers to cars. From the beginning, the concept of cyber-physical systems (CPS), or the sensing and control of physical phenomena through networks of devices that work together to achieve common goals, has been implicit in the IoT enterprise. This book focuses on the increasingly hot topic of Human-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (HiTLCPS)—CPSs that incorporate human responses in IoT equation.</p><p>Why have we not yet integrated the human component into CPSs? What are the major challenges to achieving HiTLCPS? How can we take advantage of ubiquitous sensing platforms, such as smartphones and personal devices to achieve that goal? While mature HiTLCPS designs have yet to be achieved, or a general consensus reached on underlying HiTLCPS requirements, principles, and theory, researchers and developers worldwide are on the cusp of realizing them. With contributions from researchers at the cutting edge of HiTLCPS R&amp;D, this book addresses many of these questions from the theoretical and practical points of view.</p><ul><li>An essential primer on a rapidly emerging Internet-of-Things concept, focusing on human-centric applications</li><li>Discusses new topics which, until now, have only been available in research papers scattered throughout the world literature</li><li>Addressed fundamental concepts in depth while providing practical insights into the development of complete HiTLCPS systems</li><li>Includes a companion website containing full source-code for all of the applications described</li></ul><p>This book is an indispensable resource for researchers and app developers eager to explore HiTL concepts and include them into their designs. It is also an excellent primer for advanced undergraduates and graduate students studying IoT, CPS, and HiTLCPS.</p></span>",

In this book, Internet security\npioneer Phillip Hallam-Baker shows how we can make the Internet far\nfriendlier for honest people–and far less friendly to\ncriminals.</p><p><em>The dotCrime Manifesto</em> begins with a\nrevealing new look at the challenge of Internet crime–and a\nsurprising look at today’s Internet criminals. You’ll\ndiscover why the Internet’s lack of accountability makes it\nso vulnerable, and how this can be fixed –technically,\npolitically, and culturally.</p><p>Hallam-Baker introduces tactical, short-term\nmeasures for countering phishing, botnets, spam, and other forms of\nInternet crime. Even more important, he presents a comprehensive\nplan for implementing accountability-driven security\ninfrastructure: a plan that draws on tools that are already\navailable, and rapidly emerging standards and products. The result:\na safer Internet that doesn’t sacrifice what people value\nmost: power, ubiquity, simplicity, flexibility, or privacy.</p><p><b>Tactics and strategy: protecting Internet\ninfrastructure from top to bottom</b></p><p>Building more secure transport, messaging,\nidentities, networks, platforms, and more</p><p><b>Gaining safety without sacrificing the\nInternet’s unique power and value</b></p><p>Making the Internet safer for honest people\nwithout sacrificing ubiquity, simplicity, or privacy</p><p><b>Spam: draining the swamp, once and for\nall</b></p><p>Why spam contributes to virtually every form\nof Internet crime–and what we can do about it</p><p><b>Design for deployment: how to really make\nit happen</b></p><p>Defining security objectives, architecture,\nstrategy, and design–and evangelizing them</p><p>How to Build a Safer, Better Internet</p><p>You’ll find yourself deeply concerned,\nthen fascinated, then hopeful as you read about</p><p>•    Building an\nInternet that resists online crime</p><p>•    Phishing, botnets,\nand spam: tactical, workable, immediate countermeasures</p><p>•    Establishing the\n“Accountable Web”: a strategic, long-term solution to\nInternet crime</p><p>•    Improving security\nwithout sacrificing what people love about the Internet</p><p>The Internet is today’s Wild West: too\nmuch lawlessness, too little accountability. Now, one of the\nInternet’s leading pioneers shows how we can build a more\ntrustworthy Internet: one that resists crime without frustrating\nhonest people or compromising privacy and civil liberties. Drawing\non years at the cutting edge of Internet and security research,\nPhillip Hallam-Baker offers a complete plan for reinventing the\nInternet: a plan that addresses everything from technology to\npolitics and culture. Whether you’re a technology\nprofessional, policymaker, or citizen, this book will show you how\nwe can make the Internet better, smarter, and above all, safer.</p><p>informit.com/aw</p><p>Preface xix</p><p>Acknowledgments xxiv</p><p>About the Author xxviii</p><p>Chapter 1: Motive 1</p><p>Chapter 2: Famous for Fifteen Minutes 37</p><p>Chapter 3: Learning from Mistakes 51</p><p>Chapter 4: Making Change Happen 81</p><p>Chapter 5: Design for Deployment 107</p><p>Chapter 6: Spam Whack-a-Mole 119</p><p>Chapter 7: Stopping Spam 135</p><p>Chapter 8: Stopping Phishing 155</p><p>Chapter 9: Stopping Botnets 175</p><p>Chapter 10: Cryptography 199</p><p>Chapter 11: Establishing Trust 215</p><p>Chapter 12: Secure Transport 227</p><p>Chapter 13: Secure Messaging 251</p><p>Chapter 14: Secure Identity 277</p><p>Chapter 15: Secure Names 311</p><p>Chapter 16: Secure Networks 323</p><p>Chapter 17: Secure Platforms 343</p><p>Chapter 18: Law 355</p><p>Chapter 19: The dotCrime Manifesto 377</p><p>Further Reading 383</p><p>References 387</p><p>Index 395</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><p><em>Arduino Internals</em> guides you to the heart of the Arduino board. Author <b>Dale Wheat</b> shares his intimate knowledge of the Arduino board—its secrets, its strengths and possible alternatives to its constituent parts are laid open to scrutiny in this book. You'll learn to build new, improved Arduino boards and peripherals, while conforming to the Arduino reference design.</p><p><em>Arduino Internals</em> begins by reviewing the current Arduino hardware and software landscape. In particular, it offers a clear analysis of how the ATmega8 board works and when and where to use its derivatives. The chapter on the \"hardware heart\" is vital for the rest of the book and should be studied in some detail.</p><p>Furthermore, <em>Arduino Internals</em> offers important information about the CPU running the Arduino board, the memory contained within it and the peripherals mounted on it. To be able to write software that runs optimally on what is a fairly small embedded board, one must understand how the different parts interact. Later in the book, you'll learn how to replace certain parts with more powerful alternatives and how to design Arduino peripherals and shields.</p><p>Since <em>Arduino Internals</em> addresses both sides of the Arduino hardware-software boundary, the author analyzes the compiler toolchain and again provides suggestions on how to replace it with something more suitable for your own purposes. You'll also learn about how libraries enable you to change the way Arduino and software interact, and how to write your own library implementing algorithms you've devised yourself. <em>Arduino Internals</em> also suggests alternative programming environments, since many Arduino hackers have a background language other than C or Java.</p><p>Of course, it is possible to optimize the way in which hardware and software interact—an entire chapter is dedicated to this field.</p><p><em>Arduino Internals</em> doesn't just focus on the different parts of Arduino architecture, but also on the ways in which example projects can take advantage of the new and improved Arduino board. Wheat employs example projects to exemplify the hacks and algorithms taught throughout the book.</p><p>Arduino projects straddling the hardware-software boundary often require collaboration between people of different talents and skills which cannot be taken for granted. For this reason, <em>Arduino Internals</em> contains a whole chapter dedicated to collaboration and open source cooperation to make those tools and skills explicit.</p><p>One of the crowning achievements of an Arduino hacker is to design a shield or peripheral residing on the Arduino board, which is the focus of the following chapter. A later chapter takes specialization further by examining Arduino protocols and communications, a field immediately relevant to shields and the communication between peripherals and the board.</p><p>Finally, <em>Arduino Internals</em> integrates different skills and design techniques by presenting several projects that challenge you to put your newly-acquired skills to the test!</p></span></span></span>",

Many players are already involved, but so far no single company, agency, or department can be held accountable if (and when) things go wrong. Simply put, today’s IoT is like Dodge City in the Old West before the U.S. Marshals arrived.</p><p>In this report, Mike Barlow examines what it will take to enact a set of realistic rules—including frameworks, policies, standards, and common procedures—for governing the IoT. You’ll look at five broad and challenging areas: cyber security, privacy, software licensing, data use and ownership, and government regulation.</p><p>There’s no shortage of models for an IoT governance framework, and the case for developing a set of common standards is strong. But implementation challenges, fixed mindsets, and stubborn attitudes are standing in the way.</p></div></span>",

People don’t need to do them, but when they do, they can have a phenomenal and explosive impact. From remembering someone’s first name and recalling how they prefer to take their coffee, to sending someone a handwritten ‘thank you’ note, they are all the little cost-nothing engagers that create the biggest, longest-lasting impressions. They show you care, they blow people away, and they make a very big difference.</p><p>In <i>Tiny Noticeable Things</i>, best-selling author Adrian Webster shares his ideas along with the personal experiences of over 100 contributors to help you harness the power of TNTs and take your organisation and personal relationships to the next level.</p><p>Discover the tiny tweaks that elevate the most successful teams to astounding heights, find out what makes employees genuinely happy, hear from customers about the subtle ‘human’ touches that have put smiles on their faces, and gain invaluable insights into how just the smallest of things can give such a positive lift to those around us.</p><p><b>If you want to differentiate yourself, don’t overlook the TNTs!</b></p><p><b>WARNING – THIS BOOK COULD SERIOUSLY IMPACT YOUR BUSINESS</b></p><p>‘I often say at work no-one can help everyone but everyone can help someone. I once had one of three hundred volunteers on a community build say “I can’t believe there’s generosity on such a scale.” The truth was each of those people gave what they could but the sum of those individual gifts of time and skill built a facility that changed vulnerable people’s lives. That for me is what TNTs are all about.’<br/><b>Nick Knowles</b> – TV Presenter &amp; Motivational Speaker</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><b>Printed in full color.</b><br/><br/><b>Most of the book is targeted at beginners in computing and programming. A few parts, such as the small electronics project and setting up a web server, assume some intermediate skills.</b><br/><br/>The Raspberry Pi is one of the most successful open source hardware projects ever. For less than $40, you get a full-blown PC, a multimedia center, and a web server--and this book gives you everything you need to get started. You'll learn the basics, progress to controlling the Pi, and then build your own electronics projects.  This new edition is revised and updated with two new chapters on adding digital and analog sensors, and creating videos and a burglar alarm with the Pi camera. <br/><br/>Get your Raspberry Pi up and running and doing cool stuff. You'll start with the basics: adding hardware, installing and configuring Debian Linux, and customizing the Pi's firmware to get the most out of your hardware.<br/><br/>Then the fun begins. You'll connect the Pi to your home network, surf the web, and tweet messages. You'll learn how to get the most out of Midori, the Pi's standard browser, and control the desktops of other PCs with the Pi. Then you'll explore the Pi's versatility with a series of home projects.  Turn it into a web server in your home network; convert the Pi into a powerful multimedia center so you can watch high-definition video and listen to your favorite music; and play classic video games.<br/><br/>Then you'll use the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi to build your own electronics projects, such as an \"out of memory\" alarm. You'll learn how to use digital and analog sensors with the Pi, even though the Pi doesn't have analog input ports! Finally, you'll set up the Pi camera, create your own time-lapse videos, and build an automatic e-mailing burglar alarm. Power to the Pi!<br/><br/><b>What You Need</b><br/><br/>You need a Raspberry Pi and several things that you probably already have at home, such as a keyboard, a mouse, a monitor/TV set, and an SD card. To build the electronic projects you need a few cheap parts and the Pi camera.</p></span>",

			"description": "<span><div>In this age of hypercompetition, the Internet constitutes a powerful tool for inventing radical new business models that will leave your rivals scrambling. But as brain scientist and entrepreneur Jeffrey Stibel explains in <em>Wired for Thought</em>, you have to understand its true nature. The Internet is more than just a series of interconnected computer networks: it's the first real replication of the human brain outside the human body. <br/><br/>To leverage its power, you first need to understand how the Internet has evolved to take on similarities to the brain. This engaging and provocative book provides the answer. Stibel lays out:<br/>- How networks have changed and what that implies for how people connect and form communities <br/>- What the Internet-and online business opportunities-will look like in the future <br/>- What the next stage of artificial intelligence will be and what opportunities it will present for businesses<br/><br/>Stibel shows how exceptional companies are using their understanding of the Internet's brainlike powers to create competitive advantage-such as building more effective Web sites, predicting consumer behavior, leveraging social media, and creating a collective consciousness. <br/></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><span><span><p><em>Winning Design! LEGO Mindstorms NXT Design Patterns for Fun and Competition</em> is about design that works. It's about building with LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT for fun, for education, but especially for competition. Author <b>James Trobaugh</b> is an experienced coach and leader in the FIRST LEGO League. In this book, he shares his hard-won knowledge about design principles and techniques that contribute to success in robotics competitions.</p><p>Successful design for competition recognizes that at the critical moment, at the moment when the most people are watching, at the moment when you are the most stressed, that you have only one chance to \"get it right\". You therefore need designs that are proven and robust, that will withstand variation such as from a battery running down its charge, that won't be thrown off by changing light levels, that will repeatedly do just what you have designed them to do, no more, no less.</p><p><em>Winning Design!</em> unlocks the secrets of reliable design using LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT. You'll learn proven design patterns that you can employ for common tasks such as turning, pushing, pulling. You'll reduce and compensate for variation in performance from battery charge levels and motor calibration differences. You'll produce designs that won't frustrate you by not working, but that will delight you with their reliable performance in the heat of competition.</p><ul><li><p>Written by a coach who knows what it takes to field a winning team in competition</p></li><li><p>Useful to coaches who teach, and to students wanting to grow their skills</p></li><li><p>Presents proven design patterns that help take the stress out of competing</p></li></ul></span></span></span></span>",

By contrast, Raspberry Pis all run Linux, which is a very network-competent platform. The newest Pi, the Raspberry Pi Zero W,  is WiFi and Bluetooth capable, and costs around $10 U.S. For network enabled gadgets, it makes far more sense to cross to the Raspberry PI platform, if only someone would make it easy to do.

You'll see that several projects use and explain the WiringPi system. This is is deliberately similar to the Arduino's 'Wiring' functionality, which is how sketches interact with GPIO pins. You'll learn the differences between the GPIO pins of the two devices, and how the Pi has some limitations on those pins that the Arduino does not. As a final project, in an effort to escape some of those limitations, you'll attach an AtMEGA 328P to the Raspberry Pi and configure it as a real, 8MHz Arduino with the Arduino IDE running on the Pi, and learn how to have the two platforms communicate, giving you the best of both worlds.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><b>What You'll Learn</b><br/></div><div><ul><li>Establish security with Linux system administration<br/></li><li>Set up the Apache webserver</li><li>Write CGI programs so other computers can connect to your Pi and pull data in from it. <br/></li><li>Use C/C++ from Arduino sketches to write programs for the Pi   </li></ul></div><div><b>Who This Book Is For </b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>The Arduino user who's been through all the tutorials and is comfortable writing sketches and connecting hardware to their Arduino. <br/></div></span>",

			"title": "Extreme NXT: Extending the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT to the Next Level, Second Edition",
			"description": "<span><p>Although LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT allows anyone to build complex inventions, there are limits to what you can do with what comes inside the box. This book shows you how to advance the NXT with more than 45 exciting projects that include creating a cool magic wand that writes words in thin air, building a remotely guided vehicle, and constructing sophisticated robots that can sense color, light, temperature, and more. All projects are explained with easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions, so you'll be able to create them successfully whether you're a novice or an expert. This book also shows you how to expand the programming software and use the alternative language NXC.</p><p>New input devices-such as keypads, sensors, and even the human body-are covered, along with fun games such as surfing, PONG, and SIMON. On the serious side, there are classic engineering challenges such as controlling an inverted pendulum, making a robot that follows a wall, and building several light-seeking vehicles. Some projects are just entertaining, such as the Etch-A-NXT; others are useful, such as a motorized camera mount that takes panoramic photographs.</p><p>This second edition accounts for the important changes found in the next generation NXT, and it also covers the original concepts in greater depth. Details are presented for practically unlimited expansion of the NXT inputs and outputs by using the I2C communications bus, and several power amplifier designs allow the NXT outputs to drive bigger motors. Instructions are also included for adapting LEGO Power Functions motors to work directly with the NXT.</p><p><b>In the book you'll learn how to</b></p><ul><li><p>Create sophisticated new sensors for light, magnetism, temperature, pressure, humidity and angle</p></li><li><p>Advance your nxt creations with alternate software, bluetooth communications, new motors, and muscle wires</p></li><li><p>Build a galvanic skin response meter, magic wand, numeric keypad, and panoramic camera controller</p></li><li><p>Play pong, simon, and surfing games</p></li></ul></span>",

As such, they are eager to develop ways to manage them, to enrich them and take advantage of them. Indeed, the recent explosion of a phenomenal amount of data, and the need to analyze it, brings to the forefront the well-known hierarchical model: Data, Information, Knowledge. <p> Data– this new intangible manna – is produced in real time. It arrives in a continuous stream and comes from a multitude of sources that are generally heterogeneous. This accumulation of data of all kinds is generating new activities designed to analyze these huge amounts of information. It is therefore necessary to adapt and try new approaches, methods, new knowledge and new ways of working. This leads to new properties and new issues as a logical reference must be created and implemented. At the company level, this mass of data is difficult to manage; interpreting it is the predominant challenge.</p>\n\n  </span>",

Rather than taking you through programming techniques as standalone concepts, this book explains concepts as they are used within a game.</p><p>You'll learn about variables; integer, real, Boolean and string data types; conditional if statements; fixed loops and conditional loops; modularity; arrays and lists; and predefined functions. You’ll also discover the PyGame library, which is popularly used in the development of 2D games.<br/></p><p>Key programming concepts are revisited in subsequent projects in the book to consolidate prior learning. Beyond teaching you how to code, this book explains the programming logic behind each project—exemplifying the process of designing and writing a computer game.</p><p>All the projects in this book are supported by Code Angel (mycodeangel.com). Code Angel Code Angel largely serves students and new developers and the projects work by encouraging you to ‘Learn…then play’. Taking this approach, you'll be able to build fun 2D games and enjoy playing them by yourself or with friends.

Billions of interconnected devices will be monitoring the environment, transportation systems, factories, farms, forests, utilities, soil and weather conditions, oceans and resources.</p><p>Many of these sensors and actuators will be networked into autonomous sets, with much of the information being exchanged machine-to-machine directly and without human involvement. Machine-to-machine communications are typically terse. Most sensors and actuators will report or act upon small pieces of information - \"chirps\". Burdening these devices with current network protocol stacks is inefficient, unnecessary and unduly increases their cost of ownership.</p><p>This must change. The architecture of the Internet of Things must evolve now by incorporating simpler protocols toward at the edges of the network, or remain forever inefficient. <em>Rethinking the Internet of Things</em> describes reasons why we must rethink current approaches to the Internet of Things. Appropriate architectures that will coexist with existing networking protocols are described in detail. An architecture comprised of integrator functions, propagator nodes, and end devices, along with their interactions, is explored.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>Discusses the difference between the \"normal\" Internet and the Internet of Things.</p></li><li><p>Describes a new architecture and its components in the \"chirp\" context.</p></li><li><p>Explains the shortcomings of IP for IoT.</p></li><li><p>Describes the anatomy of the IoT.</p></li><li><p>Describes how to build a suitable network to maximize the amazing potential of the IoT.</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p>Thought leaders, executives, architectural, standards and development leaders  in the evolving IoT industry.

			"description": "<span><span><p>\nCollaboration. From its academic roots to the bustling commerce\nsites of today, the Internet has always been about collaboration:\nproviding a means for people to communicate and work together\neffectively. But how do you build effective tools for\ncollaboration? How do you build tools that are simple enough for\npeople to really use, yet powerful enough to really facilitate\ncollaboration? In 1995 Jon Udell became executive editor for new\nmedia at <em>BYTE</em> magazine, taking on the challenge of building\nan online presence for a traditional print publication. In meeting\nthis challenge, he discovered that he was managing an online\ncommunity, not just an online publication. He discovered that he\nwas building not just a set of documents, but a suite of\nInternet-based groupware applications in which editors, writers,\nand readers all participated. <em>Practical Internet Groupware</em>\ndetails the lessons learned from that experience. Drawn from the\nauthor's real world experience, <em>Practical Internet Groupware</em>\ndescribes the tools and technologies for building and rapidly\ndeploying groupware applications, and also discusses the design\nphilosophy and usability issues that determine the success or\nfailure of any groupware endeavor. The key to success lies in using\nsimple tools, often open source, that effectively blend in\nestablished Internet technologies that have always had a\ncollaborative aspect (SMTP, NNTP) with new technologies that\nenhance our ability to manage collaborative documents (HTTP, XML).\nThe result is an approach that codifies the idea that many web\ncontent providers have long suspected: yesterday's online content\nis fast becoming tomorrow's network-based applications. In this\nbook you'll learn how to:\n</p><ul><li><p>Base groupware on standard Internet technologies (mail servers,\nnews servers, and web servers)</p></li><li><p>Use simple server- and client-side scripts to automate\ncreation, presentation, transmission, and search of electronic\ndocuments</p></li><li><p>Create a base of documents that contain semi-structured data\nrepresenting much of the intellectual capital of an enterprise</p></li><li><p>Deploy these solutions in a way that scales from groups of a\nfew collaborators to communities of thousands of users</p></li></ul><p>\nIf you've ever been disappointed watching a commercial groupware\nsystem used as little more than an expensive email client, or if\nyou've ever wondered how to transform simple email, news, or web\nclients from document viewers into collaboration tools, then\n<em>Practical Internet Groupware</em> is for you.\n</p></span></span>",

In this O’Reilly report, Ayah Bdeir—founder and CEO of littleBits—discusses how we can democratize the Internet of Things and help eight-year-olds, corporate executives, and professional engineers alike understand, re-create, and innovate in their connected world.</p><p>This report is transcribed from Bdeir’s talk at the 2014 Solid Conference. She maintains that the next wave of innovation around connected devices will happen only if people can understand the technology, relate it to their lives, and are able to envision and prototype solutions to real-world problems. That will occur, she says, when the Internet becomes a Material, accessible to non-engineers and non-experts who can grasp and deploy interactions with the Internet in the physical world as easily as they can with physical materials.</p></div></span>",

Mars isn't called \"The Bringer of War\" for nothing! You've just been rained on by a meteor shower and it's up to you—you!—to put your LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT robotics skills to work to save the day, and the base! And that's only the beginning of the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p><em>LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT: Mars Base Command</em> is a book of challenge. It's about challenging yourself to design and build robots to solve problems, <em>tough problems</em>. Taking a similar approach to best-selling LEGO author James Kelly's other books, this book presents a series of four challenges in the setting of mankind's first-ever manned base on the planet Mars. Each challenge begins with a backstory to set the scene. You're given instructions for constructing a playing field, including devices that your eventual robot must manipulate. Your job is to build a robot that will execute the challenge and garner you the most points.</p><p>The book requires the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Education Resource Set. Scoring sheets are included that allow for the book's use in educational and group settings. Teachers can base lesson plans around the different concepts taught in each challenge. Groups and clubs can choose to run mini-competitions in which teams or individuals compete against each other in a race to save the base. <em>LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT: Mars Base Command</em> is an excellent choice for an individual, a group, or a teacher wishing to learn about and have more fun with LEGO's best-selling robotics platform.</p><p><b>What you'll learn</b></p><li><p>How to build and test robots using LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT</p></li><li><p>How to develop problem-solving techniques as you set up and conquer the challenges in the book</p></li><li><p>How to organize and host a challenge at your school or between friends</p></li><li><p>About challenges we might face as humans move beyond Earth</p></li><li><p>To work as a team to brainstorm solutions to tough problems</p></li><li><p>To grow in your ability to make decisions when faced with multiple solutions</p></li><p><b>Who this book is for</b></p><p><em>LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT: Mars Base Command</em> is written for individuals, clubs, and teachers who want to have fun with LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT while learning more about robotics and problem-solving. The book is an excellent choice for individuals who own the kit and are slightly bored with it. The Mars Base storyline and ensuing challenges cure that boredom. Teachers and club leaders will appreciate the book for its problem-solving and teamwork applications.</p></span></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>\nBuilding electronic projects that interact with the physical world\nis good fun. But when devices that you've built start to talk to\neach other, things really start to get interesting. Through a\nseries of simple projects, you'll learn how to get your creations\nto communicate with one another by forming networks of smart\ndevices that carry on conversations with you and your environment.\nWhether you need to plug some sensors in your home to the Internet\nor create a device that can interact wirelessly with other\ncreations,\n<em>Making Things Talk</em>\n explains exactly what you\nneed.\nThis book is perfect for people with little technical training but\na lot of interest. Maybe you're a science teacher who wants to show\nstudents how to monitor weather conditions at several locations at\nonce, or a sculptor who wants to stage a room of choreographed\nmechanical sculptures.\n<em>Making Things Talk</em>\n demonstrates\nthat once you figure out how objects communicate -- whether they're\nmicrocontroller-powered devices, email programs, or networked\ndatabases -- you can get them to interact.\nEach chapter in contains instructions on how to build working\nprojects that help you do just that. You will:\n</p><ul><li><p>Make your pet's bed send you email</p></li><li><p>\nMake your own seesaw game controller that communicates over the\nInternet\n</p></li><li><p>\nLearn how to use ZigBee and Bluetooth radios to transmit sensor\ndata wirelessly\n</p></li><li><p>\nSet up communication between microcontrollers, personal\ncomputers, and web servers using three easy-to-program, open source\nenvironments: Arduino/Wiring, Processing, and PHP.\n</p></li><li><p>\nWrite programs to send data across the Internet based on\nphysical activity in your home, office, or backyard\n</p></li><li><p>And much more</p></li></ul><p>\nWith a little electronics know-how, basic (not necessarily in\nBASIC) programming skills, a couple of inexpensive microcontroller\nkits and some network modules to make them communicate using\nEthernet, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, you can get started on these\nprojects right away. With\n<em>Making Things Talk</em>\n, the\npossibilities are practically endless.\n</p></span></span>",

			"description": "<span><span><p>Internet 2.0 (previously called the Internet of Things) presents a tantalizing vision of bridging the cyber and physical worlds to forge a seamless planet-wide infrastructure in which cyber resources and physical objects can interact without human intervention. The technology needed to build the infrastructure already exists. However, more than a decade after the vision of Internet 2.0 was articulated, it remains largely unrealized except in isolated settings. </p><p>Following a background discussion, <b>Design and Construction of an RFID-enabled Infrastructure: the Next Avatar of the Internet </b>addresses three questions: what are the barriers to the emergence of Internet 2.0 as a global infrastructure? What are the features that Internet 2.0 architecture must have if it is to become a successful global infrastructure?How can one build a prototype of Internet 2.0? </p><p>The quest for answers to the above questions threads the narrative through the birthing process and maturation of two successful global infrastructures—the Internet and the web. Based on a review of the design philosophies underlying the Internet and the Web, their histories and the strategic stewardship that midwifed their births, the book presents the architectural guidelines for the Internet 2.0 infrastructure as well as a blueprint for the construction of its prototype. The discussion in the book is consolidated into a list of technical and strategic guidelines intended to facilitate the incubation of Internet 2.0.</p></span></span>",

Companies such as GE, Cisco, IBM, and Siemens are looking to transform major cities through advanced computer technologies, sensors, high-speed data networks, predictive analytics, big data, and the IoT. But, as Mike Barlow explains in this O’Reilly report, the story goes beyond technology. Citizens, too, will need to play a large role in turning cities into smart, livable environments.</p><p>According to a United Nations report, by 2050 two-thirds of humanity will live in more than 40 mega-cities of 10 million people each. All of them will need to determine how to deliver more services with fewer resources. Cities will have to improve efficiency and reduce expenditures wherever possible, through new technologies and other means.</p><p>To create a thriving environment where innovation can blossom, citizens will not only be called upon to generate much of the data, but they’ll also need to be at the center of decision-making, based on what that data reveals.</p><p>Download this report today, and learn about the progress that various groups and organizations have already made in major cities around the world, and what lies ahead for all of us.</p></div></span>",

			"description": "<span><p><br/>      From the theory-practice couple, there are various ways to approach educational and training issues. Intervention research, reflexive situated action and innovation are some of them. Through the analysis of the author's various experiences - professional and initial training, support for change, organizational assessment, experiential learning, project management - this book explores questions about social or professional contexts and the subjective training of actors. One of the challenges is to understand and challenge phenomena such as the development of autonomy and subsidiarity in changing academic or academic contexts. The book promotes the emergence of an ethical and resilient subjectivity. It will show that storytelling is methodological resources for research-intervention paradigms, support the development of actors and stimulate mobility. The book introduces the hypothesis of an operational principle of the feminine as fluid gender, added value to the collective intelligences of the processes of transformation of education and teaching, in terms of intergenerational transmission and in terms of transferability and Strategic activation of skills between business sectors and intellectual fields. This praxeology reconsiders organizations, temporalities, frames of reference, relaunches a reflection in action at the heart of structuration-transformation projects in governance of public action, as well as in terms of personal and collective encapacitation. The reflection opens to questions of management of conflictualities and management of the subjective, epistemological and professional economies.<br/>   </p></span>",

			"title": "The Contributory Revolution",
			"description": "<span>\n    \n      This book sheds light on a crucial debate on the possible role of the technosciences in meeting the challenges of the future. It shows that the current contributory revolution is global and profound, and that it concerns the whole epistemological field - from the sciences to social organizations. By delving into the epistemological dimension of the lightning transition we are currently experiencing, The Contributory Revolution identifies the levers of the salutary acceleration of collective learning, now essential, but not before the debate on a possible future has been settled via the headlong rush of the technoscientist.<br/><br/>However, after this call to move from exo-distributive technoscience, carried by deterministic and Newtonian models, to more biological and endocontributory models - or even from the arrogance of mastery to the humility of influence and alliance - it will be necessary to set its limits to avoid entering into an eco-philosophical radicalism. Only extreme humility, carried by strong spirituality, can protect us from it.\n   \n  </span>",

Among the most difficult and complex is the ability to understand and use language. </p><p>Speech-enabled automata are already serving as interactive toys, teacher’s aides, and research assistants. These robots will soon be joined by personal companions, industrial co-workers, and military support automata. </p><p>The social impact of these and other robots extends well beyond the specific tasks they perform. Contributors tackle the most knotty of those issues, notably acceptance of advanced, speech-enabled robots and developing ethical and moral controls for robots. </p><p>Topics in this book include:</p><p>•Language and Beyond: The True Meaning of “Speech Enabled” <br/>•Robots in Myth and Media <br/>•Enabling Robots to Converse <br/>•Language Learning by Automata <br/>•Handling Noisy Settings<br/>•Empirical Studies of Robots in Real-World Environments <br/>•Acceptance of Intelligent Robots<br/>•Managing Robots that Can Lie and Deceive<br/>•Envisioning a World Shared with Intelligent Robots<br/></p></span>",

These kinds of theories, whether they pertain to conspiracy theories or, more subtly, to a self-styled \"critical\" way of thinking, have always seemed to be the expression of a form of intellectual puerility. This is not to say that attempts at manipulating opinions do not occur, or that our world is free from compromised principles, or indeed corruption; far from it, but none of this is the key issue.</p><p>In fact, reality can somehow be even more unsettling than those myths, however sophisticated they may be, that envisage the media system hand-in-hand with industry, science, and so forth, all in agreement so as to lead the \"people\" away from the truth. It is more unsettling because the processes described in this book and that allow falsehood and dubiousness to take hold of the public sphere are boosted by the development of IT, the workings of our minds, and the very nature of democracy. And finally, it is more unsettling because we are all responsible for what is going to happen to us.</p></span></span></span>",

With these parts you can create thousands of unique, intelligent robots. The Unofficial LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT Inventor's Guide helps you to harness the capabilities of the NXT set and effectively plan, build, and program your own NXT robots.</p><p>The first part of the book contains a brief introduction to the NXT set. You'll then examine the pieces in the NXT set and the roles they play in construction. Next, you'll learn practical building techniques, like how to build sturdy structures and work with gears. Then it's time to learn how to program with the official NXT-G programming language (and learn a bit about several unofficial programming languages). You'll also learn what author David J. Perdue calls the MINDSTORMS method: a strategy for creating your own robots. Finally, you'll follow step-by-step instructions for building, programming, and testing six sample robots (all of which can be built using only the parts found in one NXT set).
